3,Billy Bush's wife is 'furious' at him after Trump interview leak,"billy bush may have just posted a new selfie with his wife, but rumors are swirling that all is not well back in their california paradise. the recently-fired today show host has moved back to los angeles after his now-infamous  access hollywood interview with donald trump was leaked. but sources told page six that sydney davis, bush's wife of  years, is furious about the tape and less than happy to have him back at home with their three daughters. 'she was so furious that she refused to speak with him for a while,' an nbc insider told the site. 'they are having marriage problems.' in the tape, bush can be heard calling actress arianne zucker 'hot as s***,' and also saying nothing while trump makes lewd comments about his co-host nancy o'dell. but the moment that really angered davis, a source claims, was when bush, after gawking at zucker's legs, asked her if she would give him and the donald 'a little hug'. 'it wasn't just the vile talk,' the source said. 'it's because he insisted the woman hug him and trump. it was creepy.' bush, , later released an apology for the interview and said he was 'embarrassed and ashamed', but did not make any mention of davis. 'i was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along,' he said in the statement. 'i'm very sorry.' the source said davis is enraged that bush 'was stupid enough to put himself in that position' and has now lost what could have been a life-changing gig. 'billy has brought him on himself,' they said. 'he's blown his big chance at today and he doesn't have his old job at access  to fall back on.' 'he fears his career is over. his wife is angered that he has embarrassed her and their daughters.' bush refused to comment on the article to page six, telling the site: 'i cannot take this call.' davis has also never released a statement about the incident, but on saturday she did reappear on her husband's instagram. bush returned to social media nearly two weeks after first confirming he was leaving the today show, posting a picture of him and davis in the great outdoors. 'hiking with lady long legs,' he wrote in the caption. 'nice to get out.' it was the first photo bush, , had shared on instagram in three weeks. davis features prominently in bush's instagram, most recently visiting him in new york with their daughters just before the hot mic scandal. 'teaching the squad about the nyc subway only way to go,' bush wrote in one caption, adding that his daughters hated when he said the word 'squad'. in another photo him and davis posted with their daughter on her  birthday as she received her first tattoo. bush, who worked at access hollywood for  years, had only held his new job at today for two months when he was given the boot following the trump scandal. matt lauer confirmed bush's contract had been terminated 'effective immediately' on an episode of the today show last week. lauer closed out by saying: 'all of us here at today wish billy the very best.' tamron hall also acknowledged bush's departure later in the show, saying: 'as a longtime member of the nbc family, we wish billy all the best as he moves forward.' bush said in a statement following the announcement that he was 'deeply grateful' for the conversations he'd had with his three teenage daughters. 'i look forward to what lies ahead,' he added. although speculation has swirled regarding where bush might go next - including to the rumored future trump tv - he has not yet confirmed his next step. instead it seems bush has been busy trying to return to life in los angeles, even putting up his luxury manhattan townhouse on the market for $.. bush had purchased the building for $. just last december. it was initially reported that bush walked away from nbc with $, but both his lawyer and additional sources said the figure was inaccurate. instead it is believed nbc would only pay some of the remainder of bush's $-a-year contract, according to cnn money. exact details of the settlement are not known at this time but sources said the contract does not include a non-compete clause, meaning bush can look for jobs at rivals stations. bush's attorney marshall grossman spoke with the hollywood reporter about the interview with trump, saying that bush would have been risking his job if he had not laughed at trump's statements and made lewd comments of his own. 'if billy had been passive or responded ""shut the f*** up"" to trump, billy would have been out of a job the next day,' said grossman. but one source told the daily mail online that bush had bragged about the tape while covering the olympics this summer in rio. 'what is stunning is how self-important billy is,' the source said. 'many people believe access hollywood management knew about this for much longer than they are saying and they were protecting billy while not doing the right thing and informing nbc news.'",0

20,"Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Come Out As an Item, After 'Tom Cruise Ban' Expires","now here’s something to really jump up and down on the couch for. hollywood’s worst-kept romantic secret—the relationship between jamie foxx and katie holmes—is finally out of the bag, after the couple was photographed walking hand in hand on the beach in malibu on labor day, wearing matching fedoras no less. they have repeatedly denied they are in a relationship over the past few years, despite incessant rumors and frequent sightings of them together. indeed, on one occasion, a friend of the couple, apparently unaware of the omerta, accidentally mentioned their relationship to media outlets, only to issue a hasty retraction. the absurd level of secrecy, and their public appearance together this week, looks set to give credence to an extraordinary rumor first reported by the gossip site radaronline. in september last year, radar claimed that as part of her divorce settlement from top gun star cruise, holmes had agreed not to publicly date anyone until five years had passed following the end of her marriage. “katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing tom in various ways, like talking about him or scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce,” the source claimed. “she’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, suri,” the insider told radar. “katie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms—and got $. million in child support, plus another $ million for herself.” cruise and holmes agreed to a divorce settlement in just  days, with the pact reportedly stipulating suri would not have any contact with cruise’s religion, scientology. however, had holmes broken the rules about “embarrassing” cruise, she could have lost the money, the source alleged. if true, that five-year period would have ended in june—which may explain why the couple has now come out. remarkably, most observers believe foxx and holmes have been together since —about a year after her split from tom cruise—when they were photographed dancing together at a charity bash in the hamptons. but they have largely avoided being photographed together and consistently denied they are a couple since then. there have been a few slips; for example, katie was seen with a ring on her finger in march , but foxx’s rep said it wasn’t from him. it was claimed the two met at each other’s homes and that katie sometimes disguised herself with wigs and hats to meet up with foxx without being noticed. in march , a photo surfaced showing the two stars sitting in a recording studio holding hands. jamie is seen reclining in his chair, holding katie’s hand and gazing at her, with his legs subtly intertwining hers. the actress sat with her legs crossed and staring at her phone, with her foot is resting on one of jamie’s, while his other foot sneaks around her calf. foxx denied reports of romance, insisting the two were “just friends.” in december , holmes was a guest at jamie’s surprise birthday party in new york at la bilboquet restaurant. and soon after, she was spotted at the honor bar in beverly hills with the actor’s youngest daughter, annalise. in june , there seemed to be the first public confirmation that foxx and holmes were, indeed, in a relationship when former real housewives of atlanta star claudia jordan, a friend, said they were dating. “he is very happy with her. i like that he seems very happy,” claudia said during an interview for the allegedly podcast. however, jordan quickly retracted, telling entertainment tonight the day after the podcast reveal that she had “no knowledge of jamie with katie at all.” “i’ve never seen them together. he’s never told me he’s dating her,” she said. in april this year, a restaurant customer snapped a photo of them having dinner in new york, and in may they were spotted separately boarding the same private jet at le bourget airport in paris. they were photographed leaving the park hyatt vendome hotel separately. to make it impossible to get photo evidence that they are together, they traveled “in cars with tinted windows and took secret back elevators,” us weekly reported in april. the couple is said to be exhausted by the need for secrecy, and is doubtless thrilled that the long and allegedly controlling shadow of tom cruise will no longer be a presence in their lives.",0

48,What Taylor Swift's New Make-Under Really Means,"unless you've been living on a tropical island without wi-fi, you probably know (at least) a little about the drama that's been following taylor swift around for the past year or so. there's a lot to unpack, which has led to both fans and haters speculating that her upcoming album, reputation, addresses her side of the story. from her tumultuous relationship with kanye west and kim kardashian, to the name-calling the singer received lately, you don't have to surf for long to get caught up. but her latest single, ""call it what you want,"" is a major departure from her last three releases and suggests a different vibe for her forthcoming album — and a new beauty look to match. from what we can tell, the overwhelming response to her fourth single is totally positive. whether she's admitting defeat by apologizing for all the public squabbles that went down last year, or just simply singing about being happy and in love, there's certainly something different here. the private videos-turned-music video — at least that's what it looks like to us — appear to deliver a look at a more grounded, new taylor. (she did say the ""old taylor"" was dead, if you recall.) naturally, this softer side of the star, seen riding horses and painting, comes with a make-under, too. that is: no red lipstick in sight, no ""shake it off"" bob and blunt bangs, and we even spotted her natural curls. according to twitter, this might be the real image swift is ready to bring back. whether you think this is swift giving us raw honesty and vulnerability or it's a clever move for redemption, it's hard to deny the pattern we've seen in hollywood before. most recently, miley cyrus reigned as the queen of the make-under. alongside her new album younger now, cyrus was featured on multiple magazine covers and her ""malibu"" music video where her naked face took center stage. only time will tell what this new make-under means the star, but were betting there will be a lot less red lipstick in her future.",0
49,Did Meek Mill Find Nicki Minaj In A Lesbian Tryst With Young M.A.?,"finding a story about nicki minaj and meek mill isn't exactly a stretch. last year, meek mill's beef with canadian rapper drake kept us entertained for months, and minaj is hardly low-profile. over the past few years, minaj has become known almost as well for her social media fights as for her music. as a result, celebrity watchers always seem to have an eye for the next meek mill and nicki minaj story. in recent weeks, most stories about mill and minaj have focused on whether or not hip-hop's power couple are still dating or not. in recent days, rumors have emerged claiming that meek mill walked into minaj's dressing room to find her and female rapper young m.a. in a lesbian tryst. ace showbiz has speculated that meek mill and minaj split last month after meek lost his cool. mill went on an instagram rant at minaj and then deleted his account. the same site reports that mediatakeout claims minaj has become infatuated with female rapper young m.a. and has split with meek as a result. all hip-hop claims that minaj ""plays for both teams"" and says that she certainly has ""rapped some lines over the years that have suggested that she may be a little bi-sexual or certainly bi-curious."" of course, certain media outlets rarely let the truth get in the way of a good story, and it seems that the latest mill-minaj split rumors are just exactly that - rumors with no credible evidence to support them. indeed, a glance at minaj's instagram account suggests that meek mill and nicki minaj are very much together, as they enjoyed halloween together. nicki shared a selection of images with her  million followers that showed her having fun with mill. gossip cop reports that the stories claiming mill and minaj have split are not only false, they accuse the original source of spreading false stories about the rappers. ""the webloid's perspective, though, continues to differ from reality. minaj and mill are very much still together, as she herself showed on instagram monday morning. ""and while the relationship might not last forever, minaj is not ""dropping"" mill for young m.a. mediatakeout should probably start looking elsewhere than twitter and instagram for its made-up stories."" of course, some might question why gossip cop sees itself as the arbiter of truth when it comes to nicki minaj and meek mill. after all, they seem to rely on the images posted on minaj's instagram account as evidence that meek and minaj are still an item. one has to wonder if gossip cop sees the irony in this, given that they invite another outlet to look beyond instagram for stories. many will wonder why minaj and mill do not take legal action against outlets spreading false stories. the truth may lay in minaj's hunger for publicity. according to hip-hop dx, minaj was recently quoted as saying that meek mill's high-profile beefs with the like of drake are great publicity. perhaps minaj believes that all publicity is good publicity. the reality is that the public has no right to know anything about mill and minaj that the couple doesn't want shared publicly. it is easy to claim that minaj and mill gave up their rights to privacy when they entered the entertainment industry. there is no doubt that artists like minaj and mill exploit the opportunities for publicity social media affords them. some claim this makes them ""fair game"" for the gossip columns. the reality is that nicki minaj's sexuality is her own affair, and she should not be judged or ""slut-shamed"" for it. the inner workings of minaj's relationship with meek mill are no one's business but their own.",0

77,Photos Of Angelina Jolie In A Wedding Dress Claim To Prove Quickie Marriage To Rando Brit After Brad Pitt Divorce,"photos of angelina’s jolie’s wedding dress have been making the rounds on the celebrity rumors circuit these past few months after an in touch front page cover claimed angie got married to a british man just eight months after the split with brad pitt. this would be angelina’s fourth marriage if the tabloid’s article was true, but based upon other reports, it seems safe to say this surprise wedding is likely fake news. back in april, in touch ran a cover story declaring, “angelina’s shocking surprise: wedding in cambodia! marriage no.  just  months after split with brad.” the tabloid was running with the idea that angelina jolie’s divorce from brad was being fast-tracked in order to allow a new marriage to a “wealthy, -something brit.” angelina’s dating of this “philanthropist business man” was supposedly being “shielded” from the public “by her closest friends.” worse, angelina’s children were supposedly out of the loop and had not yet met their new future father figure despite a wedding being planned. “a quickie wedding would be the ultimate payback ,” claimed an unnamed “family friend” who is the supposed source for in touch. while angelina does have a history of quickly remarrying after her previous divorces, in this case, there are angelina and brad’s six kids to consider, making a quick divorce and new marriage very unlikely. in april, gossip cop pointed out that “this tabloid has a proven history of making assumptions and trying to mislead its readers” and an unnamed source of their own claimed that angie’s  wedding rumors are “beyond ridiculous.” in a related report by the inquisitr angelina jolie’s children will soon be living just minutes away from brad pitt in los feliz, photo reveals is brad pitt dating? angelina jolie will reportedly be unhappy if he is angelina jolie’s kids are her priority, is she ready to co-parent with brad pitt? angelina jolie relying on kids to cheer her up after brad pitt split — divorce details revealed fast forward in time and in touch has been doubling down, riding the celebrity rumors train full steam ahead. now, they are running a cover allegedly showing angelina jolie’s wedding in cambodia. the front cover and the way it features angelina’s wedding dress are designed to give the impression that angie has already been married. but if you break open the tabloid, in touch is claiming angelina is still planning a future  wedding in battambang, cambodia. the latest edition is still alleging that jolie has “quietly fallen for a wealthy -something british philanthropist and businessman, and she’s eager to marry for the fourth time as soon as her divorce from brad is finalized.” the same “family friend” is supposedly spilling the beans on the movie star’s plans for a small wedding that celebrates the cambodian culture. pitt is supposedly not “standing in her way anymore.” the funny part is that no one knows the name of angelina’s dating partner, his age, or any other major life detail. in this case, gossip cop claims the “tabloid is stepping in it further and further, as the only thing that stinks around here is the magazine’s dreadful reporting.” the real problem is that it’s not merely bad information from an unknown source, gossip cop alleges that in touch “has simply been making it all up” by generating fake news. what is the truth? after all, there have been secret celebrity marriage ceremonies in the past, including well-known names like jennifer aniston, justin theroux, ryan gosling, and eva mendes. in the end, in touch and its secret “family friend” stand alone in reporting angelina jolie’s wedding plans, while gossip cop has a source claiming that the tabloid has “created a soap opera-worthy, but false, narrative.” it seems safe to say this celebrity news is debunked. what do you think?",0

79,Prince William and Kate Middleton Moving Out Of Kensington Palace? | Celeb Dirty Laundry,"prince william and kate middleton are already thinking about moving out of kensington palace. that’s because william doesn’t want his children prince george and princess charlotte to grow up behind palace walls. instead, he wants them to live a life out of the spotlight and as far away from the paparazzi as possible. in his interview with british gq, prince william said that the most important thing for him is knowing that prince george and princess charlotte will grow up in a happy, stable secure world. in other words, he doesn’t want his kids to experience the same royal hustle and bustle that he had while growing up behind closed doors. and while prince william and kate middleton haven’t fully moved in to kensington palace just yet, they are already thinking about their next move. apparently, london is the last place that william wants to be with kate and their kids. of course, if prince william and kate middleton do end up moving from kensington palace, royal observers wouldn’t be surprised. it’s taken them this long to move back to london after having spent the last several years at anmer hall. prince william has made it no secret that he doesn’t want his children to have the same childhood he had while growing up. ideally, the duke and duchess of cambridge would love to move back to anmer hall. it was a gift given to them by queen elizabeth. the property boasts a swimming pool and private tennis court and enough room for prince george and princess charlotte to run around in all day and night. but of course for prince william this won’t be easy. he can try and live a private life as much as he wants to, but at the same time he is the future king of england. prince george and princess charlotte are going to be in the spotlight whether he likes it or not. and as much as he would love to return to anmer hall in the future, it might not happen. all of his royal responsibilities and engagements are in london. that’s why many royal fans believe that sooner or later william will just have to suck up his feelings and do the job he was born to do. in the meantime, don’t forget to check back with cdl for all the latest news and updates on the royal family right here!",0

84,Robert Pattinson Recovering From Alleged Drinking Problem - Realized Substance Abuse Would Tank Career! | Celeb Dirty Laundry,"according to recent reports and hints dropped by hollywood sources, robert pattinson may have had a secret drinking problem that no one knew about. it would certainly explain why he's been hanging out with zac efron, of all people. we already know zac isn't known for his sobriety, and rob has been partying quite a lot lately. star magazine's source claims, ""rob had a hard time adjusting to fame and his breakup with kristen , and he turned to alcohol to numb it all. he drank a lot every night, and even during filming. but his health was suffering, and he realized his reputation for drinking could cost him plum roles."" is this so hard to believe? daniel radcliffe notably had a drinking problem as well, and that was without the public infamy that came with his girlfriend cheating on him in front of the whole world. clearly, something about all these ya franchises is causing its actors to turn to alcohol, but with rob's situation, he's always been a social drinker – maybe a little too much. he's admitted to drinking before auditions, and he's usually photographed at bars or parties these days. even if his vice isn't alcohol, plenty of people have said that rob's had an issue with substance abuse, even if these allegations haven't technically been proven yet. and trust me, they won't be. rob's people are very loyal to him and very protective of him, and they won't go to the press with this. and if star's source is right, then he's already realized that his health and appearance are more important, especially if he wants to continue acting. alcohol doesn't do the best things to people's faces or bodies, and it's not like rob has the acting skills to keep him employed without his looks. sorry twi-hards, but you know it's true.",0

98,Robert Pattinson Finally Has Successful Movie - Twilight Curse Over? | Celeb Dirty Laundry,"robert pattinson is elated at the success of his upcoming film, “good time”. the film premiered at cannes film festival and the movie and actor received a six-minute standing ovation. there is also oscar buzz surrounding robert, with some speculating he could receive a best actor nomination. in the gritty, crime film, robert portrays a criminal named connie nikas, who plans a bank heist with his brother. robert toned down his usually good looks, to the point of being unrecognizable and at one point, he sported shaggy, bleached blonde hair. the star admitted that he was able to shoot scenes in new york without anyone knowing who he was. when the film premiered recently at cannes, not only did it receive a standing ovation, there were audible cheers from audience members shouting “bravo” and many came up to robert to tell him what a great job he had done in the movie. critics are also raving about the film, which is a departure for robert, who is used to being ripped by critics and having his films tank at the box office. of course everyone knows robert’s big break came with the  film, “twilight” where he portrayed broody teenage vampire, edward cullen, and continued with the character for a total of four movies. the “twilight” movies became a billion dollar franchise, making robert a household name and the object of desire for teenage girls. while he was paid millions to take on the role, it pigeon holed him in hollywood and almost ruined his career. for the past few year, robert has starred in a string of box office duds, including the sappy, coming of age movie, “remember me” and mostly forgettable indie films. some wondered if he would ever see box office success again, while some were quick to blame his faltering career on the “twilight curse”. since the ending of the “twilight” and it’s sequels in , most of the young stars from the movie have failed to see further success. taylor lautner was supposed to become the next big action star, but after the box office bomb, “abduction”, he disappeared from hollywood for years before returning to the small screen with “scream queens”. other actors from the movie franchise, nikki reed, ashley greene, kellan lutz, and jackson rathbone have also had trouble finding success after “twilight” with each having a box office dud and now most are seen only in the occasional straight-to-dvd movie. kristen stewart, who portrayed bella, has continued to work regularly, although her career suffered a hiccup when it was revealed she had an affair with her married “snow white and the huntsman” director. with the positive buzz surrounding his latest film, i’m sure robert pattinson is glad his “twilight curse” appears to be over.",0

'i use to, but in this movie i smoked myself out,' he laughed, adding: 'i never want another cigarette again!' 'it really is the greatest way to quit - it's hard to come by - you really have to get a film where you have to smoke all the time, but i highly recommend it if you are trying to quit,' he went on. as well as smoking a lot for the film, the hollywood star also revealed he drank a lot too - largely due to the influence of his co-star russell crowe. 'in terms of the drinking, i am supposed to be drunk all the time in the film, but it actually worked out because i went out with russell right before we started shooting, so i was still drunk the entire shoot,' he said. he went on to add: 'so i never had to play drunk once, i was 'scooby doo-py' all day long thanks to him!' he joked. during the chat, ryan spoke of the close friendship he formed with the australian star during filming, and says russell introduced him to some iconic aussie traits.

'he was also pumping me with these australian ginger beer and vodka while he was trying to teach me,' he added. kyle was quick to interject, saying: 'that's not very australian! i don't think i know anyone who drinks that!' however, ryan wasn't having any of it, responding: 'hey listen to me... if rusty says it's australian, it's australian! you understand?' the two stars are currently on the promotional trail for the nice guys. russell plays a contract killer to ryan's private investigator in the film, with the pair working together to solve the mysterious disappearance of a porn star in  los angeles. the film is scheduled to hit cinemas in australia next week.",0
103,The Weeknd Was Spotted Holding Hands With Justin Bieber’s Ex,"if you’re an avid us weekly reader, it might appear that there are only about a dozen single people in hollywood, as they all date each other. it’s like six degrees of separation with kevin bacon, only for influencers with a penchant for fit tea and waist trainers, where scott disick is the connecting factor. here, we prove that theory. after selena gomez and the weeknd dated for about a year, they broke up and she was spotted back with her ex-boyfriend, justin bieber, almost immediately. now, it looks like the weeknd wants revenge, and is using his party monster ways to get it. while justin bieber and selena gomez have been attending church twice in one day—apparently, the new couple has a lot to repent for—the weeknd has been parading models around. the weeknd was caught canoodling with bieber’s rumored ex, model yovanna ventura. he was even spotted holding hands with the model, which is almost as serious as becoming instagram official. according to an us weekly source who saw the weeknd in action, “he was parading her around. he was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. they were pretty affectionate and were together the entire night.” the potential new couple was snapped at a birthday party in beverly hills for french montana (who dated khloe kardashian, whose sister kourtney kardashian was rumored to have dated bieber—and to make everything more confusing, the weeknd previously dated bella hadid, a close friend of the kardashian/jenner family). it’s all very degrassi, only drake is slightly less involved—although he’s rumored to be hooking up with hadid and feuding with the weeknd because of it. the weeknd and ventura were also seen leaving hyde nightclub together in the back of an suv, much like leonardo dicaprio and his model friend, -year-old juliette perkins. and there’s another leo link—the weeknd made sure to stop by leonardo dicaprio’s  birthday with model emily ratajkowski. leo’s birthday was held at the highlight room, a rooftop club that opened above the dream hollywood hotel in los angeles and currently has two stars on yelp. of course, there were plenty of models milling about, leaving ample options for the weeknd—but not all of them had been linked to bieber in the past. it looks like bieber, gomez and the weeknd should all start writing for their next break-up albums…or maybe they can all just collaborate on one.",0

141,Did Angelina Jolie Fake Maddox Jolie Pitt's Adoption? Inside The Shocking Claims,"angelina jolie is famous for adopting kids from around the world, but did she obtain her first son, maddox, using falsified documents? maddox's real cambodian father has come forward with the shocking claims that jolie doesn't have legal power of attorney over the -year-old. according to celebrity dirty laundry, mounh sarath says that he has official paperwork from cambodia that confirms he is maddox's father. jolie started maddox's adoption back in , and brad pitt legally adopted him in . but according to sarath, he actually has power of attorney over the teenager. sarath and jolie have not spoken to each other in years. even more scandalous, the adoption agent jolie worked with, lauryn galindo, was jailed for falsifying names, birth places, and dates of children from cambodia. at the time jolie adopted maddox, the united states had just set forth stricter adoption laws for children from cambodia. did she rush the process to bypass the stricter laws? the sun reports that sarath works in charity and local aid in cambodia. given his falling out with jolie and the circumstances surrounding maddox's adoption, sarath's opinion of the tomb raider star is pretty low. ""i would be happy if cambodia didn't see her again,"" he added. jolie's interest in cambodia started when she filmed her  hit film in the country, lara croft: tomb raider. she recently directed a movie based in cambodia, first they killed my father, and has visited the country on several different occasions. the allegations against angelina jolie couldn't have come at a worse time. the actress is currently engaged in a heated custody battle with her ex-husband and just returned from promoting her newest film in cambodia. maddox was also the source of a lot of controversy in jolie's split with pitt. shortly after filing for divorce, reports surfaced that pitt had physically abused maddox on a private plane. pitt was eventually cleared of all the accusations, but not before his public image took a major hit. things between maddox and jolie, meanwhile, couldn't be better. hollywood life reports that jolie took maddox and his five siblings on a week-long trip to london. during their stay, jolie and maddox ventured off to buckingham palace for a mother-son date. the pair was spotted leaving the royal palace and looked happier than ever spending time together. it isn't clear if they actually met any members of the royal family, but there's a possibility they mingled with prince william. the outing came after jolie gave a speech at the london school of economics. jolie spoke to a crowd of students about her career promoting human rights around the globe. the actress, who has been an avid human rights activist over the years, also spoke at the united nations in london. maddox was the only member of the jolie-pitt family that accompanied jolie to the palace. earlier last week, jolie was spotted taking maddox's siblings out to a toy store in london. the kids have since returned to the united states. as far as jolie and pitt are concerned, insiders claim that the drama is starting to cool down. although they haven't finalized the divorce, a source revealed that they are at a better place in their breakup and are on the verge of working things out. given how their divorce played out in the early months, it's definitely good to hear that jolie and pitt are working through their differences. they have not released an official comment on maddox's adoption. tell us! do you think angelina jolie could have actually faked the documents to adopt maddox? let us know in the comments below.",0

146,Blake Griffin: Did He Kick His Baby Mama Out For Kendall Jenner?,"it's only been a few weeks since the world learned that blake griffin and kendall jenner are dating, but it looks as though the lanky couple is moving very fast. they've been hanging out in public; she's already banned from the staples center ... yes, they've checking off items from the ""new kardashian-professional athlete relationship"" checklist at breakneck speed. there's just one problem. neither blake nor kendall was  percent single when they met, which means they're both in the process of distancing themselves from their most recent exes as they simultaneously attempt to build a new relationship together. insiders say kendall was still dating a$ap rocky when she started hooking up with blake, but it sounds like that situation won't present much of a challenge. “he isn’t the type to settle down or be a good boyfriend, so she’s playing the field too,"" one insider said of rocky. so we imagine he wasn't too torn up about being cut from team kendall. blake, on the other hand, is in a bit of a tighter spot. the la clippers forward has two kids with brynn cameron, whom he dated for several years. though the couple had experienced relationship troubles in recent months and even lived apart during a trial separation, sources say cameron was blindsided by the news that griffin was dating kendall. according to sources close to the couple, cameron unexpectedly moved out of the home she previously shared with griffin this week. and naturally, many are claiming that kendall is to blame. ""both brynn and blake have been staying at rented places since their breakup happened. it seemed like they wanted to give it time for the dust to settle before disrupting the kids with a big move,"" one insider reveals. ""that said, brynn feels totally betrayed and mortified that blake has chosen to be so public with kendall, and she just wants this whole mess to be over,"" the informant adds. ""he’s in clippers training camp now, so she figured it was the perfect time to do it."" so it sounds like blake and brynn were headed in the vague direction of splitsville, but kendall was what drove them to finally call it quits. fans are reportedly angry, as brynn was a beloved member of the clippers community. wait until the nba season starts and all the ""kardashian curse"" talk comes with it.",0

""the couple will spend the rest of the time off in norfolk, where the final refurbishments are being completed at their new country home, anmer hall, on the queen's sandringham estate,"" shared royal family sources with vanity fair.",0

203,Is the Queen preparing abdicate?,"his holiness pope benedict xvi announced it through the vatican, to shock and surprise. a poised queen beatrix of the netherlands revealed it in a video uploaded to youtube, and king juan carlos of spain confirmed it by signing a parliamentary bill. queen elizabeth, however, has vowed that abdicate is something she will never do. abdication is, after all, a dirty word in the corridors of royal palaces, especially after the earthquake caused when her uncle edward viii quit the throne in  to marry the twice-divorced wallis simpson. and there is no indication that that will ever change. yet with the queen now into her  year, and with the hard-working duke of edinburgh choosing to retire last month at the age of , plans are afoot which, if implemented, would see charles appointed king in all but name. palace sources have indicated that the queen has told her inner circle that, if she is still on the throne at the age of , she will ask for a piece of legislation called the regency act to come into force – granting her eldest son full power to reign even while she still lives. i have spoken to a number of high-ranking courtiers who made it clear that preparations for a transition are moving ahead at pace. they have all confirmed that a regency with charles taking the lead is now, at the very least, a real possibility. one senior former member of the royal household said: ‘out of the profound respect the queen holds for the institution of monarchy and its stewardship, her majesty would want to make sure that she has done everything she can for her country and her people before she hands over. she is dutiful to her core. ‘her majesty is mindful of her age and wants to make sure when the time comes, the transition of the crown is seamless. ‘i understand the queen has given the matter considerable thought and believes that, if she is still alive at , she will seriously consider passing the reign to charles.’ clarence house – the household of prince charles – is making no comment about plan regency, as it has been called. however, it is understood to be a matter of increasingly open discussion at court. but palace staff responsible for communications have been ordered to be ‘up to speed’ on the  regency act, which grants power to the heir apparent ‘in the event of the incapacity of the sovereign through illness, and for the performance of certain of the royal functions in the name and on behalf of the sovereign in certain other events’. the development is all the more significant as it comes against the backdrop of momentous shifts at court – a series of senior staff changes and departures at buckingham palace and kensington palace, home to the young royals. the queen’s private secretary, sir christopher geidt, , resigned his position two weeks ago, sparking turmoil and a ‘wholesale regime change’ – as revealed in the mail on sunday. his shrewd deputy – former banker, political adviser and television executive edward young,  – will replace sir christopher after a suitable handover period. i understand that a number of other high-profile figures – many loyal to sir christopher – are poised to leave the royal households at buckingham palace and kensington palace after his unexpected exit. they include assistant private secretary samantha cohen, the capable former press secretary and sir christopher’s number three in the private office. ms cohen, who is australian, is said to be a firm favourite with the queen. falklands and afghanistan veteran, vice admiral tony johnstone-burt, the master of the queen’s household, is also said to be weighing up his position. sir alan reid, the keeper of the privy purse, had been due to retire at the end of this year but decided to depart when prince philip stepped back from public duties, leaving the job to his deputy, sir michael stevens. at kensington palace, the duchess of cambridge has hired a new private secretary, catherine quinn, who is head of the university of oxford’s said business school. it is understood she will take up her new role in october. prince william’s private secretary, former ministry of defence communications expert miguel head, and prince harry’s private secretary, former blues and royals captain ed lane fox, , are also said to be considering their options. perhaps significantly, there have been no major staff changes at clarence house, home to prince charles. of course, the transition to a world in which significantly more royal duties are undertaken by the younger generations is already well under way. next month, the duke and duchess of cambridge will step into their new roles as full-time working royals, and prince harry will be expected to carry out more engagements at his grandmother’s side. ‘as ever, the queen wants there to be the minimum of fuss,’ said the former member of the royal household. ‘of course, for obvious reasons, abdication is not even a consideration.’ that is not in doubt. on her  birthday in  the then princess elizabeth took to the airwaves to make one of her earliest radio broadcasts. speaking from cape town, where she was on tour with her parents and younger sister, it was as unequivocal as it was momentous. ‘i can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole empire listening,’ she said. ‘i should like to make that dedication now. i declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.’ it was a conviction that she confirmed in her coronation oath on june , . while it may be acceptable for queen beatrix and king juan carlos to pass the baton to the next generation, palace aides still believe the ‘a word’ is not part of her majesty’s vocabulary. there is no escaping the passage of time, however, or the fact that the queen, at , is the oldest and longest-serving monarch in the history of these islands – one who is now without the company of prince philip, her consort, on the hundreds of engagements she carries out each year. the monarch is in remarkable health, yet courtiers are increasingly aware that there is only so much a nonagenarian, albeit one with incredible stamina, can realistically be expected to achieve. charles has already been filling in for his mother, representing the head of state on foreign trips during her diamond jubilee year to australia and new zealand. earlier this year he went in her place to canada to mark the nation’s  anniversary. on a tour of the persian gulf, he represented the crown and was treated like a king with other royals bowing to him. more will no doubt come as the queen gradually scales back her demanding list of duties. a regency, however, would ensure a more formal handover – and, indeed, the act was considered in more recent times when the queen first acceded to the throne. documents show that following the coronation of , the young elizabeth ii intervened to ensure that prince philip – and not her sister princess margaret – would take over as regent if she were to die or succumb to illness or mental incapacity before charles, then aged four, reached adulthood. this was not, of course, required. times have changed, so with the heir apparent fast approaching his  birthday next year, what would it mean in practice today? certainly, it is not be a decision to be taken lightly. to safeguard against a coup, a regent can only be installed once a decision is taken by at least three of the following: the sovereign’s consort, in this case the duke of edinburgh; the lord chancellor, david lidington; the speaker of the house of commons, john bercow; the lord chief justice, the incoming sir ian burnett; and master of the rolls, sir terence etherton. clarence house and buckingham palace officials have played down this speculation, as one would expect. but as one insider told me: ‘we are in uncharted territory right now – a monarchy in transition with a clear shift in power.’",0

206,Miley Cyrus Wedding Rumors: Will Miley Force Liam Hemsworth To Sign A Prenup?,"wedding rumors for miley cyrus and liam hemsworth are heating up, and now many fans want to know if either party plans to protect their assets before tying the knot. miley just happens to be worth about ten times as much as her aussie beau and because of that, there are reports that she really wants liam to sign a prenup before they walk down the aisle. life & style has reported that miley's money demands have caused stress in her relationship with liam, and that the couple is currently fighting about whether or not a prenup is even necessary. miley cyrus is worth a whopping $ million while liam boasts just $ million himself. life & style claims that miley wants to set up a prenup to cover their combined $ million as they head toward marriage. apparently, it doesn't matter to miley if everything about her relationship with liam seems perfect right now. cyrus is a shrewd business woman and she knows things can go south very quickly, just like they did in . miley wants to make sure that her money is safe even if her renewed romance with liam doesn't stand the test of time. ""they've had heated arguments over this,"" a source told the magazine. ""he's a firm believer that prenups spoil the romance of a marriage and that if they are truly in love, it's not needed. he's assured miley he isn't interested in her fortune and has enough money of his own."" it's only fair that miley ensures that her money is protected with a prenup in the event she does marry liam. cyrus is already toning down her over-the-top antics in order to make hemsworth happy. it was miley's wild ways that pushed liam away the first time around. now that liam and miley have grown closer, fans have noticed that her hair has grown much longer and miley isn't acting out nearly as much as she was in past years. on the other hand, liam has realized that even if she is a little weird, miley is the woman that he loves. while miley has toned it down some, liam is definitely meeting her in the middle and giving the singer some freedom to still express her true self. after reports that miley moved in with liam, it looks like she also bought a house of her own. us magazine reports that miley just put $. million down on a -bedroom home in malibu. ""the plan is for liam to stay there while they reconnect, and then move in permanently when he's ready,"" a source close to cyrus reportedly told the gossip site. it's unclear why miley bought the home since it was reported that she was living with liam, not far away. now, the pair own a pair of malibu homes. could this be their way to get to know each other again without being together  hours a day? so far, neither miley nor liam are talking about their reconciliation. then again, they aren't hiding their love either. ever since miley was spotted in australia during the new year's holiday, she and liam have been seen spending time together. there have even been reports that mutual friend kellan lutz congratulated the pair and headlines about liam purchasing a new ring for miley. not to mention that cyrus was seen sporting her old engagement ring in a few pictures on instagram already. will the prenup continue to be an issue for miley cyrus and liam hemsworth? fans hope not and many are excited that miley has her man back. let's just hope this new miley is still fun and outrageous, and that liam doesn't tame the entertainer so much that it hurts her career, if they can even squash the prenup issue and make it to the altar anyway.",0

224,EXCLUSIVE PICS: First photos of Ariana Grande since Manchester attack,"an emotional ariana grande was spotted for the first time since the terror attack at her manchester concert on monday as she touched down in her hometown of boca raton, florida. the pop star could be seen in tears as she exited a private jet on tuesday afternoon and was greeted by her boyfriend mac miller, who was waiting on the tarmac to comfort the -year-old singer. ariana, who was dressed in head-to-toe black and carrying a purple unicorn onesie, shared a lengthy embrace and kiss with miller before being whisked away in an suv caravan to a family member's home in a nearby gated community. miller could also been seen warmly embracing ariana's mother joan, who like her daughter was dressed entirely in black, and giving her a kiss on the cheek as he helped her into one of the waiting vehicles. police cars were also seen surrounding joan's nearby home, less than  hours after  people lost their lives and another  were injured when a improvised device went off inside manchester arena just moments after ariana performed her final song. joan was one of the people in attendance when the bomb exploded on monday and heading backstage to congratulate her daughter when the night suddenly described into chaos. rather than panic however, she immediately got to work helping some of the young concertgoers make their way out of the arena and safely backstage, where she stayed with the group and helped to calm them down amidst the mayhem. ariana has yet to speak publicly about the devastating attack, but did post a message on twitter early tuesday, writing: 'broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words.' the pop star has also now indefinitely delayed her much-anticipated european tour, which kicked off in stockholm on may  and was set to wrap up on june  in rome. she and joan made a quick and quiet departure from england early tuesday morning with a little help from fellow pop star taylor swift, who lent the two women one of her private jets. sources told tmz, however, that swift wasn't involved in the process, as the private jet was financed down the middle by grande's touring corporation live nation and manager scooter braun. isis is now taking credit for the monday night massacre, with authorities identifying -year-old salman abedi as the suicide bomber responsible for the carnage. the blast from abedi's improvised devise went off just seconds after ariana finished her final song of the evening, with some of the injured victims telling authorities that the explosive appeared to be filled with nails and nuts. abedi is the british-born son of libyan immigrants and lived just a few miles from the arena where ariana performed on monday. police are still investigating whether or not abedi might have been aided by any accomplices in the attack, and at least one other man has been arrested by authorities in connection with the attack. that individual, who is , has not yet been identified by police. investigators are spending a good deal of their time now pouring over the thousands of videos filmed on monday by ariana's young fans and the arena's surveillance footage for any clues as to how the attack was planned and who may have helped to carry it out. prime minister theresa may announced tuesday evening that the threat level in the country had been raised to critical, meaning an attack could happen imminently in britain. if the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in britain since four suicide bombers killed  london commuters on three subway trains and a bus in july . manchester arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving. some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended. one witness said grande had just finished her final song and said 'thank you, manchester,' before leaving the stage when suddenly there was a loud explosion. the incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another. taxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down. city officials said the true spirit of manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident while twitter and facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for. the names of the victims are also slowly becoming public, revealing that most were young female teenagers, no doubt thrilled to be seeing ariana perform live for the first time. eight-year-old saffie rose roussos is the youngest victim who has been identified at this time. even more tragic is the fact that the young girl's mother lisa still has no idea as she was left critically injured in the blast and is still fighting for her own life. saffie's older sister is also being treated for injuries she suffered during the attack. georgina callander, , lost her life as well in the attack, just hours after the teenager tweeted at ariana to let her know how excited she was to see her in concert. two years prior, georgina had got to go backstage and meet grande after her performance, and later shared one of the photos she took with the pop star. saffie and georgina lived just two miles from one another in the village of tarleton, and on tuesday their friends, family, neighbors and even complete strangers gathered to remember the young girls, whose lives were cut tragically short. some carried balloons and others flowers while many had signs that read 'i love mcr.' with the whole of britain in mourning over this tragedy, both political parties agreed to halt campaigning ahead of the upcoming june  election our of respect for the victims. a number of celebrities also offered up their thoughts and prayers in the wake of monday night's attack. david beckham, who became a global sports superstar while playing for manchester united, posted on facebook: 'heartbreaking news from manchester. as a father and a human what has happened truly saddens me. my thoughts are with all of those that have been affected by this tragedy...' his spice girl-turned designer wife victoria, who lived in manchester after marrying beckham, added: 'my heartfelt thoughts and prayers for all those effected by the tragedy in manchester last night.' swift, who later offered up her private jet to ariana, wrote: 'my thoughts, prayers and tears for all those affected by the manchester tragedy tonight. i'm sending all my love.' katy perry also commented on the violent attack, saying: 'praying for everyone at @arianagrande's show... broken hearted for the families tonight. broken hearted for ari. broken hearted for the state of this world.' and rihanna wrote: 'manchester has always been so close to my heart! these are innocent vulnerable kids, this could've been any of us! i'm devastated! 'praying for the beautiful souls we lost, their families and loved ones, for the survivors who will forever be impacted by this #manchester.' one of the most poignant remembrances though may have come however from british-born talk show host james corden, who was taping his late night program in los angeles when the attack occurred on monday. 'it shocks me every time we hear this sort of news, that attacks like this can happen, but especially when there will be so many children at this concert tonight. 'many of you won't have ever been to manchester, but you will definitely have heard of it. it's famous all over the world for so many wonderful things, great football teams, man city, man united. it's famous for incredible music, oasis and joy division. 'it was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes, it's the home of the inventor of the first computer. it's a place full of comedy, and curries, and character. 'but when i think of manchester, the place that i know, i think of the spirit of the people there, and i'm telling you a more tight knit group of people you will be hard pressed to find. 'strong, proud, caring people with community at its core, and if it was even possible, the spirit of the people of manchester will grow even stronger this evening. 'my thoughts and prayers are with everyone in manchester tonight, all of the staff of the men arena, all of the security teams, all of the emergency services, ariana and her team, and all of those families affected by tonight. we'll all go to bed, holding our little ones even tighter this evening.'",0

240,Jim Carrey Claims Donald Trump Is A 'Reptilian-Illuminati Blood Prince',"jim carrey has told fans and supporters that donald trump is not human but is a “reptilian that shapeshifts between human and reptile form” and he has witnessed the president shapeshift “in the flesh, before my very eyes, and in my opinion, as personal warning to me.“ speaking to supporters at the signature gallery in las vegas where he is hosting his first ever art exhibition, “sunshower”, the beloved comedic actor dropped hints about the themes buried deep in his paintings. “i am interested in what is behind the veil of reality, the real power structures that control the universe. i’m no longer interested in the daily facade. i’ve put everything i know into these paintings.” carrey first met donald trump at a boxing match held at the trump hotel & casino in atlantic city in the early . a popular tv actor at the time, carrey was criticized by trump’s associates for “failing to entertain” the future president. but according to carrey, he was “avoiding him like the plague” because he witnessed trump shapeshifting when he arrived at the venue. “donald trump has a long reptile face, an oversized beak, and his scales are a disgusting grey color, like sewer water,” carrey said. explaining that donald trump shapeshifted between this state and his human form “at least three times” while greeting him, carrey claims that he also saw trump shapeshifting while greeting other celebrity guests. “his hands turned into scaly reptile hands while he gesticulated at random acquired objects he deemed beautiful or valuable. when he smiled his teeth changed into razor sharp reptile teeth and glistened like jewel-encrusted daggers.” “it wasn’t just me. i’m not going to name names, but these secrets are well known in certain circles, among those in the know.“ carrey says he believes trump shapeshifted while greeting him as a show of strength and a warning not to mess with the dominant reptilian-political illuminati of which he is a “blood prince.” “this branch of the illuminati, the most powerful branch, they come from bavaria,” carrey said, explaining that “bavaria is trump’s ancestral homeland.” asked if he had proof of his claims, carrey told his supporters to “watch what happens when these issues get raised in the media. the gatekeepers will try to deny i said these things. when that doesn’t work, they will try and destroy my reputation.” carrey also told his fans and supporters to “look deeply” at his artworks to “decipher their real meaning.” “there are some things you can’t say, but you can paint. i have put everything i know into those paintings.“ “it’s , i’m eating goldfish and talking about reptilianism with new friends. i’ve never felt more at peace,” carrey said. carrey’s first hand experiences with the reptilian-illuminati chime with my own research and second hand accounts. i have dedicated the last five years to researching the elusive, tyrannical powers that rule our world, travelling to over  countries, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people from very different walks of life have told me stories about seeing ‘people’ briefly turn into reptilians before their very eyes. i’ve been told this by californian news anchors, ethiopian goatherds, and australian aboriginals, just to name a few. a danish taxi driver described driving past a group of vip guests at the  bilderberg meeting in copenhagen and seeing some of their faces turn reptilian and some of their hands and feet take on a reptilian look. in peru a respected psychic told me she sees people in power, like obama, david cameron and hillary clinton, turn into reptiles whenever she watches an international news channel. the world’s ruling class have tyrannical control over the mainstream media, as well as our food, water, and air supply, and they are actively dumbing down the masses. the evidence against them, ancient and modern, is enormous and continuing to grow.",0

247,Kendall Jenner: Why She’s Quitting ‘KUWTK’ But Remains Proud Of Kylie’s Spin-off Show,"kendall jenner continues to distance herself from the reality show platform that made her family a household name, with sources stressing that the model wants to have a legitimate career. kendall jenner has found herself modeling for some of the biggest campaigns in fashion for the past two years, and as her brand continues to skyrocket, so are her annual earnings through endorsements, sponsorship deals, and modeling contracts. seeing how well things have been going with her career, kendall jenner sees no reason why she should remain on keeping up with the kardashians. she’s grown tired of sharing her personal life on television, and now that she’s working harder than ever before, she doesn’t even have the time to shoot scenes for the show anymore. from kendall jenner’s point of view, the -year-old wants to build a brand that’s mainly focused on her modeling career. sources say that by being on reality tv, kendall thinks it could potentially hinder her chances of being taken seriously in the fashion industry. she’s worked extremely hard to distance herself from being known as nothing more than kim kardashian’s little sister, and while it’s paid off for her, for the most part, kendall jenner can’t stress enough that she needs to leave the world of reality television to truly be taken seriously by some of the biggest fashion designers in the world. sharing everything about her life, including who she’s dating, could potentially have an effect on the relationship she will go on to form with industry people. to eventually become as famous and successful as naomi campbell or kate moss, being on reality television is not going to cut it for her. “kendall will still make some appearances here and there in , and in kylie’s new show, but only when she’s in town and around — she wants to limit her time on camera as much as possible,” an insider tells hollywood life. for now, she has limited the amount of appearance she makes on kuwtk, along with her sister’s forthcoming reality show, life of kylie. but her overall intentions are to eventually stop making appearances entirely, saying that it’s no longer where her mind is at. “kendall’s modeling career is going really amazing, and she’s worked so hard to be taken seriously. she feels like she’s finally getting there and that she’s now being booked because she’s kendall the model, not just one of the kardashians. kendall is grateful for the start in her career that the show gave her, it was a great springboard for her, but at the same time, it was a hiderence—and it’s not the thing that she wants to be known for in her life.” last month, the e! network confirmed that kylie jenner had landed her own spin-off titled life of kylie, variety reports, which is expected to premiere in july. the series will follow kylie on her journey to branching out and building an empire that’s focused on beauty and cosmetics. kylie cosmetics, her reputable company, is already said to make millions in profit each month, and while kylie the businesswoman will often be seen on the show, kendall’s little sister will also touch upon personal subjects such as her breakup with tyga. anything that could potentially make kendall jenner look bad is something that she wants to stay away from, so if there’s any sort of drama or tension on kylie’s show, kendall is sure to keep her distance because she doesn’t want to be seen in that light. do you think it’s a wise move for kendall jenner to ditch kuwtk in favor of building a respected modeling career with longevity?",0

250,"Angelina Jolie, Unbroken","“i never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,” angelina jolie says. “and that’s o.k., because i know who i am, and the kids know who i am.” “i never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,” angelina jolie says. “and that’s o.k., because i know who i am, and the kids know who i am.” los angeles — angelina jolie was sitting barefoot on the porch of her luscious new home, explaining why she wants to save the world, when duty called. her youngest son, knox, , poked his little blond head around the screen door. “shiloh needs you,” the boy said quietly, referring to his middle sister, who is . “shi?” ms. jolie called, before disappearing with a whoosh of her black caftan. ten minutes later, she was back. shiloh’s beloved bearded dragon, vlad, had fallen ill and was now, to shiloh’s distress, convalescing at the vet’s. “that will be the rest of my day,” ms. jolie said, settling into a cushioned patio chair, “learning all about the health issues of the bearded dragon.” ms. jolie went on to lament the imbalance of a world where californian pets get cushy care while millions of people the world over lack access to proper medical treatment. it went unmentioned that she was saying this from her $ million two-acre hilltop estate, in a gated pocket of the los feliz neighborhood, a home she bought for herself and her six children in the spring, following her split from brad pitt. perhaps more than any other celebrity, ms. jolie, , has kept herself firmly planted in two vastly different worlds. she’s both the glamorous a-lister whose every move is tracked in headlines (“angie and the kids left target because it didn’t serve hot dogs,” read one recent newsflash), and the humanitarian do-gooder who has made more than  trips to the field as part of her united nations work. apparent contradictions account for her elusive allure. ms. jolie has been enduringly hard to peg, a woman who cannot easily be lumped into a single category because she occupies many at once. she is a peerless glamazon as well as the women’s health advocate who told the world about her preventative double mastectomy. she has a meticulously managed public profile yet professes not to care what others think. she remains near the pinnacle of celebrity’s cruel pyramid, even though her recent movies only made money when she was camouflaged (“maleficent,” “kung fu panda”). she is obsessed over — if, in the united states at least, not exactly beloved — and fixed in the cultural firmament as america’s vixen despite having a half-dozen-strong brood. and even though the public appetite for salacious details of her personal life has long eclipsed interest in the films she has directed, ms. jolie doggedly brings tough, obscure stories to the screen. three of the four movies she has made are set in wartime, including her latest, “first they killed my father,” based on the true story of loung ung, who as a young girl survived the cambodian genocide and is now one of ms. jolie’s close friends. while ms. jolie’s earlier movies garnered tepid reviews, several critics have anointed “first they killed my father” her best yet. it is told entirely from the little girl’s point of view, in khmer, and received a standing ovation at the telluride film festival, where it had its premiere. netflix was to begin streaming it on sept. , when it will also open in a small number of theaters. ms. jolie said she could not have made the movie had she not first directed “in the land of blood and honey” () about the bosnian war, and “unbroken” (), based on the true story of an american g.i. taken prisoner in world war ii. (she and mr. pitt starred together as a married couple locked in a different kind of conflict in her  drama, “by the sea”). “it wasn’t a conscious plan of, i was going to make war films, it’s just what i was drawn to,” she said. ms. jolie has an indelible connection to cambodia, not least because it completely reordered her life. before first visiting in  to shoot “lara croft: tomb raider,” she had been a hollywood wild child, a ravishing goth weirdo who, at the oscars that year, dressed like elvira, mistress of the dark, and locked lips with her brother. she also got publicly hot and heavy with her second husband, billy bob thornton, and wore a locket with droplets of his blood around her neck. the grace and humility she saw in the cambodian people, along with the lasting effects of the genocide, threw hollywood life into unflattering relief. “once you get exposed to what’s really happening in the world, and other people’s realities, you just can’t ever not know, and you can’t ever wake up and pretend it’s not happening,” she said, “your entire life shifts.” she adopted maddox, now , from an orphanage, divorced mr. thornton, and threw herself into humanitarian and environmental work, finding lasting inspiration in wartime survivors and aid workers. “the real will to survive, and the strength of the human spirit, and the love of the human family becomes so present, and that’s how we should all be living,” ms. jolie said. “when you’re around it, it’s quite contagious, and you know to learn from it.” the air pressed in hot and close as she spoke, and the sun was climbing its way toward a broiling midday. i was all but keeling over, but ms. jolie, who adores the heat, was as composed as a sphinx. (we soon moved to the air-conditioned climes of her kitchen.) ms. jolie is a contained and poised presence, yet also light, breaking every now and then into lilting laughter. she is as visually arresting as she appears onscreen; the sculpted lines of her face alongside the soft o’s of her eyes and mouth make hers an otherworldly beauty. though slight as a sylph, she says she doesn’t exercise, beyond dipping into the pool with her kids and vaguely intending to someday jump on a treadmill. although it was still august, the children — maddox; pax, ; zahara, ; shiloh; knox; and his twin, vivienne — had already begun home school. they would be accompanying her to the telluride and toronto film festivals — maddox has an executive producer credit on the film — and were making up for lost lesson time, working with tutors in various corners of the house, learning, among other things, arabic, sign language and physics. i asked ms. jolie if she ever felt like the coach of a small team, and she replied that more often she felt part of a fraternity. “they really help me so much. we’re really such a unit,” she said. “they’re the best friends i’ve ever had. nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.” that last sentence hung in the air, perhaps a subtle allusion to, or indictment of, mr. pitt, who adopted maddox, pax and zahara, and is the biological father of shiloh, knox and vivienne. the dissolution of their -year romantic partnership came last september, after an incident aboard a private jet — purportedly involving mr. pitt and maddox — prompted her to file for divorce. shortly afterward, ms. jolie and the kids moved out of mr. pitts’s estate, living in a rental for nine months as she struggled with the decision about whether to buy a new home. “it took me a few months to realize that i was really going to have to do it. that there was going to have to be another base regardless of everything,” she said, her voice falling quiet and low, as it would each time the subject of the split arose. “that there was going to have to be a home. another home.” the new house, a beaux arts manse that was once the residence of the legendary filmmaker cecil b. demille, is a beaut, with a library, rolling lawns, cascading fountains that burble into the pool, and a view of the griffith observatory. ms. jolie had an elaborate treehouse built — “more a parkour treehouse,” she said — and the kids helped decorate and pick out the furniture for the whole house. they have an agreement, ms. jolie said, that not everyone can agree on everything, but you have to try to like it if you don’t hate it. if you do hate it, you can overrule. “it has a lot of moments,” ms. jolie said of the home, “it’s happy. happy and light, and we needed that.” i asked how everyone is doing now. “none of it’s easy. it’s very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and i just want my family healthy,” she said quietly. are they? “they’re getting better,” she said, her voice approaching inaudibility. she intimated that “first they killed my father” might have informed her decision to leave mr. pitt. the film centers on ms. ung’s family members, some of whom survived, and ms. jolie said she thought a lot about what family meant during production, and how they should help each other and take care of one another (the film is adapted from ms. ung’s  book of the same name). “loung had such horrors in her life but also had so much love, and that is why she’s all right today,” ms. jolie said. “that is something i need to remember.” determined to make the film as cambodian as possible, ms. jolie teamed with the cambodian director rithy panh, who received an oscar nomination for his  documentary, “the missing picture,” and enlisted thousands of cambodians as extras. ms. jolie said maddox was her right-hand man, working on the script, taking meeting notes and bantering with mr. panh in french. some of the scenes were shot on massacre sites, so the crew arranged for monks to pray and set out incense and offerings beforehand. “she is very loved there,” said mr. panh, who served as a producer on the film. he added that he was struck by ms. jolie’s humility, and how she intuitively communicated with the children on set, despite her shaky grasp of the cambodian language. (ms. jolie said a suggestion in vanity fair that children were cruelly hoodwinked in the casting process was “a mischaracterization.”) ms. ung said ms. jolie, who has cambodian citizenship, shares her countrymen’s sensibilities. “in cambodia you don’t raise your voice, you speak kindly to people, you greet people with your hands together and bow,” ms. ung said. “all of this comes naturally to her.” as our interview wrapped, ms. jolie joked that she would next work on a comedy. “i will get funny at some point,” she said, adding that she was working on “maleficent ,” a sequel to the disney fractured fairy tale. “that was a little funny,” she said, wryly. ms. jolie also seemed aware of how she might be beheld by the public; the removed ice queen to mr. pitt’s affable down-home missouri boy (his revealing interview in the summer issue of gq style helped burnish his image as the more relatable one). but she grew up a punk in school, she said, and was used to not fitting in, and being someone people had opinions about. “i never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,” ms. jolie said, walking me down her driveway, “and that’s o.k., because i know who i am, and the kids know who i am.” she quickly embraced me goodbye, and i set off into the sun and the heat, as the heavy security gate slowly drew shut behind.",1
251,Late-Night Hosts React to O.J. Simpson Parole News,"o.j. simpson was granted parole thursday, after serving almost nine years in prison for armed robbery and assault with a weapon, and late-night tv had a lot to say about it. on abc, jimmy kimmel mocked the local reporters who repeatedly announced throughout thursday that ""the juice is loose,"" before explaining who simpson was to his younger viewers. ""o.j. simpson — for those of you too young to remember, is the second-most embarrassing person associated with the kardashian family, right after scott disick,"" said kimmel. ""technically, the juice is not on the loose yet — he could be released by oct.  — on which date, he will be picked up at the lovelock correctional facility via helicopter and flown directly to the set of dancing with the stars, or bachelor in paradise. whichever show is currently in production."" on comedy central's daily show, trevor noah teased simpson for saying he has mostly led a ""conflict-free life."" impersonating the former football player noah said, ""yeah, i had a lot of conflict, and i mostly got off free."" noah continued: ""o.j. and his people reminded us that he’s been a model citizen in prison. he petitioned for books for the library; he coached a softball team; he never got in trouble. to me, that’s kind of a reason to keep him in prison — it’s the only place he’s not committing crimes.” ""o.j. got away baby,"" said stephen colbert in his monologue on cbs' late show. ""finally, he has the opportunity to find the real killer. step one: buy a mirror. it'll help."" colbert also showed a photo of simpson and donald trump from  and joked the photo was taken ""when it was still a coin toss which one of those guys would be president and which one would end up in jail."" on nbc's tonight show, jimmy fallon told his audience to be careful calling an uber now, to make sure it's not a white ford bronco. “o.j. actually video-conferenced into his parole hearing today, because the board was  miles away from his prison. yeah, not a good sign when even the parole board is scared to be near him,"" he said. ""a lot of people didn’t know how to feel about the news. on one hand, o.j. is a convicted felon. but, on the other hand, he managed to keep trump off tv for a whole afternoon,"" said fallon, joking that it's kind of like community service. the former football, film and tv star could be released as soon as oct. , at which point he will have served the minimum of his nine- to -year sentence. commissioners who heard his case voted unanimously to grant the -year-old parole. the  conviction — which stemmed from a failed attempt to steal sports memorabilia and other items he claimed had been stolen from him — came  years after his  acquittal in the murders of his ex-wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ronald goldman. the  murder trial was a national sensation at the time, with interest reignited last year with the debut of fx's award-winning miniseries the people v. o.j. simpson: american crime story. when asked if he would be able to stay out of trouble, simpson explained that he had taken an alternatives to violence course, and also said, ""i had basically spent a conflict-free life,"" which got an immediate reaction on social media given the sensational murder trial and years of abuse allegations from his ex-wife. in his closing remarks, he apologized again. ""i'm sorry it happened, i'm sorry, nevada,"" he said. ""i thought i was glad to get my stuff back, but it just wasn't worth it. it wasn't worth it and i'm sorry.`""",1
252,The new directions of One Direction: what do the solo projects tell us?,"this morning, one direction’s liam payne dropped stripped down, his debut single, which can best be described as something that certainly exists. that is, unfortunately, the nicest thing there is to say about the track – particularly when compared to the solo work of payne’s contemporaries harry styles, niall horan, zayn malik and louis tomlinson. over the past year, the four seemed to have called dibs on certain sounds and musical influences, leaving liam to try and marry the worlds of ed sheeran and justin bieber, to no avail. but we’ll get to that in a second. here’s who it seems the boys of  are modelling themselves after. whether they’re succeeding is another thing entirely. since he quit the band long before the boys called a hiatus, it’s not surprising that the singer’s debut (mind of mine, released in march ) seemed to dramatically strive to establish itself as the musical antithesis of one direction. between interviews that saw zayn slagging off the band and his aesthetic rebrand that saw him secure a collaboration with donatella versace, malik seemed keen to distance himself from the artist he used to be in the most dramatic sense. which explains why he took the abel tesfaye road of singing about sex, drugs, and a combination of the two. but where the weeknd took years to earn mainstream recognition (and worked his way through the industry), zayn’s fanbase was already built in – which is why his rejection of one direction seemed particularly harsh. so while malik is a smart, talented, and multi-dimensional person, his debut lacked the authenticity that defines his fellow r&b artists. not that he can’t come back from that: having spent the past year opening up about his anxiety and keeping his head down, he could emerge for his sophomore effort as a grown-ass man, aware that the best artists are the sum of all parts – boy bands and all. with harry, it’s a toss-up between bowie and jagger and even robbie williams – particularly when you consider the sweeping nature of styles’ first single, sign of the times. (enter: millennium.) but thanks to tracks including carolina, woman, and even kiwi, the future dunkirk star seems to have modelled his full-length debut after the expansive nature of jagger and co – at least if you take into account how varied the rolling stones discography gets after leaping away from garage rock. which is something styles seems to have emulated and recognized, from his stage presence (which he showed off on james corden’s late late show all week) to his sense of fashion to the way his album reads like a generous tribute to british rock. no two songs are the same, nor are two tempos. like jagger, the singer sings primarily about women, his complicated relationship with them, and the experiences that come with being a young man. what will be interesting is whether he reinvents himself similarly as his career continues – dance moves and all. is this a stretch? absolutely. but because just hold on saw louis collaborate with steve aoki and do his own singing, it seemed the  alum was channeling -era harris (who’s been singing his own songs) while simultaneously maintaining the dj’s long legacy of working with big names. it’s still a generous likening, especially since louis has only delivered one track with no announcement of a forthcoming full-length. but that could also be a strategy: where his compadres are actively working the circuit, tomlinson seems content to drop a banger every so often, leaving fans to thirst after him, instead of vice versa. his longevity, however, will depend on whether he gets behind the production board or begins working the dj booth. because as great as calvin’s harris’ vocals are, i don’t think any of us need entire albums of them. here is a thing none of us were prepared for. where our town seemed to solidify horan as the next shawn mendes or ed sheeran, slow hands was on bieber-circa-girlfriend levels of catchy, thanks especially to a slowed-down, seductive beat. like bieber via ’s believe, slow hands reintroduced horan to his fans as an adult. but where zayn used shock tactics to differentiate himself from his past, niall borrowed from the pages of bieber’s book, and used his songwriting to prove he wasn’t just some dude with an acoustic guitar. he could sing well, he could creatively adapt for a grown-up solo venture, and he still cherished his existing fan base and the legacy of his former self. which justin did, once upon a time, too: while bieber leapt from child prodigy to rebel without a cause, his musical evolution never really faltered, and his career was kept afloat by the legacy he refused to condemn or distance himself from. so if niall considers himself another bieber, that would be brilliant: he would arguably be setting himself up for even bigger and better success, fortunately too old to relive justin’s  ventures. i ... don’t know, you guys. i mean, you can see what liam wanted to do: he wanted to grow up musically, borrowing from the gospel of zayn by simultaneously throwing shade at one direction while singing about sex and parties. the problem is, strip that down is even less believable – partially because zayn has been candid about his partying and personal turbulence (where liam is now a father) and because zayn only ever dissed  in interviews, not in his actual music. however, strip that down is largely a thirst trap, appealing to a tired brand of heteronormativity through liam’s references to “girl”, whoever she may be. (because my dudes, he’s certainly not speaking to cheryl that way.) you can see the way he takes the ed sheeran approach to vocals, but loses the heart by bragging about how many women are hanging off him, and you can also hear the way he’s using the nick jonas approach to post-band life by adopting slick beats while peacocking. the thing is, sheeran and jonas have both mastered their art by making songs seem sincere or as part of an in-joke with their audiences – they’re not delivered on a platform built to broadcast their own greatness. so here’s hoping that liam’s next single features more of what he’s actually good at: singing. because while you know he’s thinking of himself as a cross between sheeran and jonas, he’s coming off as a salty brat who has no reason to complain about anything.",1

254,'Au revoir for now': Kate and Wills bid a fond farewell to Paris after wowing the French during their two-day Brexit charm offensive,"duke and duchess of cambridge waved goodbye to paris after their successful two-day tour earlier they cheered on wales as they played their final six nations match to the dismay of the royal couple, france scored in the  minute and converted to win - they also met with victims of nice and bataclan terror attacks at military hospital as part of their tour next they visited the musée d'orsay where they rekindled their love of art in the impressionists' gallery the duke and duchess of cambridge have bid a fond farewell to paris after wowing the french people during their two-day brexit charm offensive. in a cheery final message before departing, a kensington palace spokesman said: 'what an incredible two days in paris! thank you to everyone who made the visit so memorable. au revoir for now!' kate was handed a posy of lilac flowers by a pair of schoolchildren before the royal pair headed back home to the uk. earlier they endured a nail-biting finish to the six nations rugby today when victory was snatched from wales after twenty minutes of overtime at the stade de france. kate looked a picture of elegance in a double breasted carolina herrera coat and flashed a beaming smile as she chatted to william when the players entered the pitch. as the dragons took the lead the future prince of wales finally looked back in his comfort zone after appearing awkward since he was filmed dancing 'like a dad' in a club in verbier, switzerland earlier this week. but he looked a bag of nerves as france pushed for the line in the dying seconds and wales desperately held on in a bid to secure the win. to his dismay, france scored in the  minute and converted to win -. the couple were watching wales' final six nations game as part of their two-day tour to paris. this morning they met with war veterans and victims of the nice and bataclan terror attacks at the famous les invalides military hospital. they then visited the impressionists' gallery at the musée d'orsay before playing rugby with some french youngsters outside the eiffel tower. the couple will be flying back to the uk early this evening by private jet. while attending their engagements this morning, the royals were but  miles from the scene of a shooting at paris's orly airport. but they are unaffected by the airport's closure as it is understood that the couple had always intended to use a different airport to get home. the duke and duchess arrived for their first engagement in the centre of the city on time this morning and there was no obvious sign of increased security. kate was wearing a chic chanel suit - a choice bound to delight fashionistas - in muted shades of black, grey and burgundy, with her hair loose, courtesy of her personal hairdresser, amanda tucker, who is travelling with her. on her feet were a favourite pair of block-heeled burgundy tod shoes, a more practical choice for the paris cobbles than her normal high heels. william and kate were first visiting les invalides, an iconic french military hospital in the heart of the city. they learnt about the important historic and current roles of the site, in particular its work supporting veterans undergoing rehabilitation programmes. the duke and duchess also met victims and emergency service teams from the bataclan and nice terror attacks. among those they met were jessica bambal akan, , who was shot seven times in the leg, hip and back as she dined with friends at la belle equipe restaurant in paris. there was also kevin, a -year-old fireman, a concert-goer at the bataclan, who was shot in the leg. both have been undergoing rehabilitation at the hospital ever since. jessica said the encounter meant a great deal to both, who have found it invaluable to speak about their trauma and prove to the public that life goes on. william told the bataclan attack survivors: 'we think you are very strong and very brave, you've made amazing progress.' the duchess added she would be keeping an eye out for jessica's work, after learning she is retraining to work in fashion. jessica, , said: 'at first  i was a bit shy and didn't want to talk about it because of all of the pain and grief. 'but now i want to say we are not only victims, we have lives, we have boyfriends, girlfriends, work. i want to speak about my friend who died to honour him, i want people to remember who he was.' she was shot on her birthday as she dined with three female friends outside the restaurant, who all survived the attack. her friend victor munoz, who was inside, was killed with one shot. 'we were very lucky,' she said of her friends outside. 'we all got shot and we all survived.' the prince hailed the 'quick-thinking' of her boyfriend, who made a tourniquet for her leg on the scene. 'it's been very difficult,' she said. 'i like to move. i got through this because of my friends, my boyfriend, my family who helped me all the time.' the duchess asked how she had found readjusting to life after the accident. 'you feel like you're in a dream,' jessica said, adding that she had tried to view her rehabilitation work as a job in the week, and enjoy her weekends as she did before. she used her convalescence to learn italian, and is now hoping to work organising fashion shows, telling the duchess she had noted her chanel outfit. 'i was ambitious, i am still ambitious,' she said, speaking in english. 'if i want revenge i must live and work and prove they  can't touch how we live in our great country. it sparked something: i realised you need to live.' kevin described how he attended a concert at the bataclan, only to hear shouting and gunfire. they started shouting at the audience and opened fire. 'anyone who shouted was shot, so i tried to be as quiet as possible. i was hit twice in the leg but lay there and kept quiet.' of meeting the duke and duchess, he said: 'it was a very positive experience because i was able to speak about this experience and what i went through. 'it feels very important to tell these stories and be listened to.' asked how his emotional recovery had been, he told the royal couple: 'it gave me a challenge, i like a challenge.' the duchess said: 'you're a very brave man.' the couple also spent time with the elderly inhabitants of les invalides, including one -year-old man who escaped the nazis three times during the second world war. the duchess was charmed by colonel jean camus, , and chief petty officer georges zwang, who will turn  in may. both reached for her hand to kiss it as they were introduces, prompting a smile from kate. col camus fought in france in -, was taken prisoner by the germans, escpaed, joined the french resistance and escaped twice after being captured by vichy forces and the germans. he managed to reach london in  and served as an intelligence officer in the central bureau of intelligence and operations, before returning to france in august  for the end of the war. as they were introduced, the duke exclaimed: 'as escape artist!' the veteran joked: 'i spent most of my life in jail. i could write a book.' the duke replied: 'you should, it would be a bestseller.' col camus added: 'i didn't expect to live so long, it's a surprise. i'm very glad to see you living and not on pictures as i saw the queen and charles. thank you for listening.' the veteran told the couple his wife had been made an mbe but the now suffers from alzheimer's and could not make the journey to meet them. the duchess said: 'please send her our best wishes.' they were also introduced to chief petty officer georges zwang, who will turn  in may, served in the french navy from - and went on the join the royal navy. he then joined the free french forces and took part in the landing and battle of provence where he was seriously injured. captain stephane, from french special forces, severely injured during operation serval, joined them, along with mrs montcorge, . she was a lieutenant in the free french forces in  in london and was appointed as liaison officer to general patton commanding the  us army from june  to the end of the war in . she told the duke and duchess she had been appointed after studying in the us. moving to the prosthetics room, the couple met sergeant phillippe, who was training in the french army as a dog handler when he had motorcycle accident in france leaving him with one prosthetic leg. he has previously met the duke, who presented him with medals at the invictus games, where he won a gold in the  and silver in the  in , then a gold in the driving challenge and bronze in the  in . the duke said: 'you are a huge inspiration for all the other guys.' they also met two servicemen suffering from ptsd, to be known as kevin and francis, who discussed their mutual love of football and tonight's rugby match. the duke and duchess, who was wearing a chanel coat, were greeted by general ract madoux, governor of les invalides, who introduced them to a short history of the hospital, built in  by louis xiv for his veterans. today, les invalides houses around  pensioners, with a cutting-edge prosthetic department helping wounded servicemen and women. william and kate were also shown an ornate book, explaining how charles ii, king of england, wrote to louis xiv to ask him to share with him the plan about the creation of the hospital. it went on to inspire the foundation of the royal chelsea hospital. the duke of duchess of cambridge rekindled their shared love of art today when they visited paris's iconic musee d'orsay. the couple first met when they both studied history of art at st andrew's university in scotland (although william later switched to geography) and were keen to visit the museum which houses the largest collection of impressionist masterpieces in the world. in a tender moment william and kate even looked out onto the world's most romantic city through the face of a giant clock. the couple toured the gallery on the second day of their two-day visit to paris. it remained open to the public throughout, prompting gasps from tourists who crowded round to take pictures and videos of the royals on their phones. home to some of the greatest works of french and european art produced in the  and  centuries, they had specifically asked to see one some of claude monet's most famous paintings including one of his water lilies series, painted in . the french impressionist painted around  oil paintings of the flower garden at his home in giverny, which were the main focus of his artistic output during the last  years of his life. the couple were also shown other monet masterpieces, including his  work coquelicots or wild poppies and his 'parasol' paintings from  titled, essai de figure en plain-air femme a l'umbrelle. they stopped to take a close look at london, houses of parliament, which was inspired by monet's  visit to london when he was struck by the 'effects of fog on the thames'. william, , asked director laurence des cars: 'this is one of his most famous paintings isn't it?' the  masterpiece will go on loan to the tate britain later this year as part of an exhibition called: 'the impressionists in london'. the couple were also shown monet's la rue montorgueil a paris, a  painting of a street which the queen visited during her  tour of france. art enthusiast kate, , who graduated with a : in , asked lots of questions, particularly about edouard manet's olympia, a nude painted in . seemingly unfazed by the topless scene, william pointed to a black cat in the picture and was told it was a tongue in cheek addition. another painting that caught their eye was gustave caillebotte's raboteurs de parquet () featuring half-naked men sanding a floor by hand. a keen photographer, kate has been patron of the national portrait gallery in london since  and is also patron of a charity called the art room, which encourages disadvantaged children to express themselves through artistic endeavours. kate once said: 'i am a firm believer in the power of art to make a difference'. william, whose father and grandfather are both keen artists, also studied history of art before switching to geography. it is thought that kate's support in convincing him to switch subjects rather than quit university altogether is what first drew them together. situated on the left bank of the seine, the musee d'orsay is houses in the former gare d'orsay, a beaux-arts railway station built between  and . it holds mainly french art dating from  to  including works by monet, manet, degas, renoir, cezanne, gaugin and van gogh. having been used as a railway station for more than  years, the decision was taken to close it down because its platforms were deemed too short for modern trains. in  permission was granted to demolish the building but after an eight year row it was finally placed on the list of historic monuments and former french president georges pompidou gave the go ahead for it to be turned into an art gallery. it opened in , with its original clocks remaining as a reminder of its transport heritage. a man was shot dead at paris orly airport this morning after taking a soldier's gun and fleeing into a shop, taking aim at soldiers. less than two hours earlier, three police officers were shot at in a suburb in northern paris by a gunman during a routine stop-and-search operation. police now believe the shooting in the northern paris suburb of stains, which left one officer injured, was carried out by the man who was later killed. after fleeing the scene, the man stole a woman's car at gunpoint.",1

(but, make no mistake, the parade will go on.) but that’s not even it, really, carrey said. “it’s not our world. we don’t matter. that’s the good news.” great!",1

266,Jennifer Aniston Finally Pregnant At 48 Years Old? | Celeb Dirty Laundry,"jennifer aniston and justin theroux have been married more than a year, so the inevitable pregnancy rumors will begin. according to the latest cover issue of star magazine, jennifer aniston is 'finally' pregnant at  years old. now, we've heard in the past that jennifer aniston has struggled to get pregnant, even back when she was married to brad pitt. in fact, one of the most persistent rumors is that brad pitt dumped jennifer aniston because she couldn't get pregnant, and he wanted children so badly. the fact that he went on to start a family with angelina jolie immediately after their divorce speaks to that rumor. so poor single jennifer struggled for a few years, until she met fellow famewhore-in-chief, justin theroux. the two stayed together, against all odds, and even decided to get married. and now, they are reportedly going to start having babies. sources tell star, ""it's taken jen and justin  months of ivf treatments, and they've been through so much heartache along the way, but now it seems their baby dreams have finally come true."" the source also adds, ""i'm sure they've already planned to throw two baby showers in l.a., one for jen and one for justin, since this is his first time being a dad."" well, first – jennifer aniston pregnancy rumors are nothing new. we've heard this time and time again, and this is probably the  time that tabloids have come out with a jennifer aniston is pregnant! cover. however, we have to question – could this time actually be true? you can only throw darts at the board for so long before they start sticking to the board, and this might be an instance where the tabloids have guessed about it or so long that it's now coming true. however – even if jennifer aniston is pregnant (and that's a big if) – it is extremely unlikely that they're planning on throwing two baby showers; that seems excessive, even for them. while a pregnancy would undoubtedly be good news for the couple, they would probably want to keep it undercover – at least for a little while – and throwing two big baby showers isn't going to help them keep the news discreet. or heck, maybe they want the attention – they'll be able to use the pregnancy to sell their movies, tv shows, etc. come back to cdl for all your jennifer aniston news and updates. do you think jennifer is pregnant this time?",1

274,‘Megyn Kelly Today’ Ratings Not All Sunshine for NBC’s New Morning Host,"with its host reportedly making a salary of $ million a year and a new set having been constructed within nbc’s rockefeller plaza headquarters in midtown manhattan, “megyn kelly today” is more costly than the previous  a.m. segment of “today.” losing viewers, in the long run, would be a problem. ms. kelly’s first week was highly scrutinized, and the early reviews for the show were brutal. she addressed them at the end of her hour on sept. , saying, “it’s been very exciting, it’s been so educational, i’ve been just so delighted by the media response, which is really” — she shook her head before continuing — “no.” after a breath, she added, “the viewer response has been awesome!” as ms. kelly moved away from the sometimes prosecutorial persona she inhabited during much of her tenure at fox, there were a few bumpy moments. the “will & grace” star debra messing said after appearing on the show that she regretted having done so. jane fonda blanched when ms. kelly asked her to talk about plastic surgery procedures she has had. and a vulgarity uttered by a cameraman who inadvertently walked into a shot went viral. another awkward moment came on oct. , two days after the mass shooting in las vegas, when ms. kelly cut off tom brokaw, the former longtime nbc anchor and network eminence, as he went into a lengthy discourse on gun rights and the national rifle association. “got it,” ms. kelly said, adding that she had to “leave it at that, tom,” before shifting to a commercial break. (mr. brokaw later told the washington post that he was having problems with his hearing aid. “i’m a kelly fan,” he added.) ms. kelly has said that the show would be a mix of a talk show and a news show, and it has moved in both directions, from typical morning fare — celebrity interviews, a segment involving an adorable crime-fighting dog — to gritty discussions of the o. j. simpson and menendez brothers cases. nbc has said from the start that it would be patient with the show. andrew lack, the network’s news chairman, told affiliates months ago that he did not expect things to be “perfect” with both of ms. kelly’s new programs — she also hosts a sunday evening show, which is on hiatus — in the early going. at least for now, it appears that ms. kelly’s main competitor, abc’s “live with kelly and ryan,” will maintain a lead in the ratings. in the top  media markets, “live” beat “megyn kelly today” by  percent in households last week, according to nielsen. exact audience figures for last week’s episodes of “live,” a syndicated show featuring kelly ripa and ryan seacrest, will not be available until next week. it averaged an . million viewers in the week before ms. kelly’s debut, with , in the -to- age range. for ms. kelly and nbc executives, there was one hopeful nugget buried in the nielsen data: the number of viewers in the -to- demographic was , on sept. , after having fallen to roughly , the day before.",1
275,Jim Carrey Says He Has Sailed a 'River of Sorrow' in Emotional Stage Appearance,"the -year-old comedian stopped by documentarian and activist michael moore‘s broadway show the terms of my surrender on thursday night for a candid conversation about the current political climate in the wake of president donald trump‘s election. among the many revelations in the -minute chat — which touched on everything from carrey’s political paintings and sculptures to the dreamers to the white supremacist march in charlottesville, virginia to kathy griffin‘s recent controversy — was a tender moment in which carrey said he’s embraced hopelessness in his life a means of coping with difficulties. “there’s a virtue in hopelessness,” carrey said. “i’m not kidding. you’re off the hook and you don’t have to worry about what’s coming. ‘okay, the world freaking ended. that’s great. now what?'” “give up! surrender to the idea that things are bad and yet still, from , feet up, we don’t matter,” he continued. “things are happening and we’re going to happen along with them whether we like it or not. but we don’t matter. … once you lose yourself, you’re pretty okay. just get you out of the way.” while carrey’s advice was sparked by moore’s questions about the trump presidency, the truman show star said his philosophy was born out of pain he’s gone through in the past. “we’re all so afraid of the river of tears,” carrey said, explaining that he, like many, had avoided his problems in the past with “food and sex and noise and gadgets.” “the fact is, going down the river of sorrow and suffering is the way to freedom,” he continued. “i’ve gone through it and i’m telling you, you don’t survive it. you don’t come out of it on the other side. you might come out of it with a body, but there’s no you attached to it.” he added: “it’s tough to be yourself if you don’t have a self.” carrey has been open about struggling with depression since his youth. the past few years have been difficult ones: in , his on-and-off girlfriend cathriona white died by suicide. since then he’s been involved in legal battles with her family over wrongful death allegations, which he denies. carrey told moore that choosing what part he wants to play in life has helped him move forward. “know that no matter what happens, this is not who you are,” carrey said. “you choose the part you want to play in this life. i want to be a good guy. i want to do good things. i want to make people happy and i want to help out when i can. so you do what you need to do.” elsewhere in his chat with moore — which came towards the end of the the oscar-winning director’s impassioned two-and-a-half hour one-man show — carrey laid into president trump, claiming the -year-old former celebrity apprentice host deceived working-class voters into thinking he wasn’t a member of the “elite” group he had so aggressively attacked during his campaign. “they say that the best trick the devil ever did was convincing people that he didn’t exist, but i think the best trick was convincing  percent of this country that this truffle pig who spends half of his presidency gargling caviar behind the wheel of a golf cart isn’t the elite,” carrey said. “he has a golden f—— apartment. it’s just incredible.” “how does he do that with a baseball cap?” carrey asked. “i used to think clark kent’s disguise was flimsy. ‘dude you’re superman, you’re busting out of the suit, it’s obvious!’ trump makes that look intricate.” carrey also criticized what he called “a war on intelligence and discernment in this country,” saying that people are “made to feel guilty for being smart.” carrey said that he hopes both trump supporters and critics find a way to understand one another moving forward — as “every person is to be cared about and thought of as precious, including the people that don’t agree with us.” “i don’t like this trend of, ‘if you don’t agree with me, it’s hatred,’ ” carrey said. “when you don’t agree with someone, you don’t agree with them. it doesn’t mean that it’s hatred. and we have to get back to that and have discourse. we can disagree with each other.”",1

278,"Nicki Minaj Did NOT Wear Hot Pants And Crop Top To Serena Williams’ Wedding, Despite Report","nicki minaj did not wear hot pants and a crop top to serena williams’ wedding, despite a bogus report based on a photoshopped image. for starters, the rapper didn’t even attend the tennis star’s nuptials. gossip cop can set the record straight. williams got married to internet entrepreneur alexis ohanian in front of friends and family in new orleans on thursday. the guest list included many celebrities, including beyonce, kim kardashian, kelly rowland, anna wintour, ciara and eva longoria. minaj wasn’t in attendance, but the irish website her posted a doctored instagram photo that shows her posing at the party with beyonce and rihanna. the site titled its inaccurate article, “what nicki minaj wore to serena williams’ wedding is not really ok,” and says the singer showed up to the ceremony sporting “white leather hotpants and a crop top.” the misinformed outlet insists minaj’s outfit was “kinda too much,” further maintaining that she “very much overstepped a wedding etiquette line.” but the site’s opinion about the rapper’s attire is completely moot. neither minaj or rihanna were at the tennis player’s wedding. both music stars were superimposed into a photo of beyonce posing alone at the ceremony. it’s unclear if the irish outlet is trying to trick its readers or get duped by the fake image itself, but minaj didn’t wear an inappropriate outfit to williams’ wedding, which she didn’t attend. it should be noted, gossip cop has had to debunk several false stories surrounding the tennis star’s nuptials in the short time since she walked down the aisle. we recently busted hollywoodlife for fabricating a report about beyonce and kardashian having an “icy exchange” at the wedding. gossip cop also called out radaronline for making up a story about kardashian getting yelled at for using her phone at williams’ wedding. this latest article related to the event is similarly phony.",1
279,Taylor Swift Debuts a Bold Makeunder on Her Reputation Album Cover,"taylor swift has officially returned. this morning, after a social media blackout followed closely by cryptic clips of a coiling, striking snake, swift pulled back the curtain on her forthcoming album, reputation —which expects a november  release, according to a subsequent frame—with a stark black and white beauty shot featuring a new take on her trademark beauty look. gone are the bangs, the polished bob , and the fringed shag . in their place, the singer debuts a dampened mane of soft, finger-raked waves, with a hint of james dean volume at the crown. the homage makes sense: the singer's portrait strikes a rebellious note, from her posturing to the silver chain choker around her neck. and though makeup is still present, swift's painted matte lip looks more femme fatale than ladylike, coupled with bare skin and long eyelashes. considering the album's telling title, and the clever repurposing of social media's favorite snake emoji, it seems swift is taking her image into her own hands. so far, devil-may-care looks good on the pop star.",1

281,Mehgan James Speaks Out On Rob Kardashian Dating Rumors,"has rob kardashian found a new boo in bad girls club alum mehgan james? media outlets began reporting last week that rob and mehgan were in the ""early stages"" in their relationship, with an anonymous insider telling in touch, ""rob's been seeing mehgan james for almost three months, and most of the kardashians are very upset about it because mehgan is known for being out of control and volatile. the kardashians want rob to find a woman who is kind and calm."" shortly after the story began to gain traction, rob denied even knowing who mehgan was, writing on social media, ""wait reading online about some chick i'm dating megan something. not true never even met her or heard of her before."" after retweeting rob's twitter statement, mehgan later addressed the rumors on her instagram page, writing, ""before any of you start defaming my character, i'm clearly not dating rob, nor have i ever confirmed that i was. you all just so happen to believe everything you read."" ""i posted one pair of arthur george socks / weeks ago & now all of a sudden i'm a homewrecker, a fraud, a hoe,"" she continued. ""i do not control the media, but we all know who has the media on their payroll. sooo... don't point any fingers this way!"" ""i'm just 'megan something,' that most of you never heard of,"" she went on, referencing rob's tweet. ""i don't have that type of power. i was just as confused as everyone else and was told not to even entertain it."" but here's where it gets interesting. tmz reports that james was actually the one behind the rumors. according to their sources, mehgan's team leaked the story to the press in the hopes of building her following. mehgan then slammed that story on instagram too, writing, ""i did not fake anything. like i said i never confirmed that i was dating rob. any one that asked i told them it was not true. and not to mention, the media is trying to make me look like the villain here when they are the ones who pieced together a story with no receipts. it takes two people to fake a relationship, any one who fakes a relationship by themselves is a complete idiot!!"" take a look at mehgan's full response below.",1
282,"Kathy Griffin predicts career is over, says Trump 'broke me'","embattled comedian kathy griffin says she's not afraid of donald trump and plans to keep making fun of him but maintained that she's sorry for a video that depicted her holding a likeness of the president's severed, bloody head. at a rambling press conference friday, griffin tearfully predicted her career is over and said trump ""broke me."" since the video was posted tuesday, she has lost her job co-hosting cnn's new year's eve special and had all her upcoming comedy shows cancelled. trump, first lady melania trump and donald trump jr. have publicly criticized the video. griffin, who asserted that she has been contacted by the secret service, said the trumps are ""trying to ruin my life forever."" ""the president, the first lady and the secret service have all made very clear their view on those thoughts,"" white house press secretary sean spicer said. griffin, , repeated her claim that the video was a parody, meant as a pointed comeback to trump's remark last summer that former fox news channel personality megyn kelly had ""blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of wherever."" ""i'm not laying down for this guy,"" she said in one defiant moment. ""i'm going to keep making jokes about this guy."" republican party spokesman mike reed called the press conference a ""desperate attempt"" to change the conversation. ""kathy griffin's career was over long before she attempted to make a disgusting joke about decapitating the president,"" reed said. ""what she did was wrong and president trump and his family have every right to condemn it."" the california gop later sent out a fundraising email calling griffin's photo shoot disrespectful and obscene. griffin appeared surprised at the number of cameras and reporters in a packed conference room at her lawyer's office, her hands shaking at one point when she took a sip of water. she switched between contriteness to combativeness during the press conference, during which she attempted several nervous jokes that drew laughs mostly from her attorney, lisa bloom. bloom said the comedian has a first amendment right to make fun of the president. ""whether or not you get, or like, her artistic expression, in america, kathy has the right to parody the president,"" bloom said. ""she never imagined it would be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against trump."" bloom, a former trutv anchor and lawyer gloria allred's daughter, has represented wendy walsh, who has accused former fox news channel personality bill o'reilly of hurting her career after she spurned his advances. o'reilly has denied the accusations backlash against griffin has continued to grow. griffin said five of her performances have been canceled this week. venues in new jersey, new york, new mexico, pennsylvania and california canceled upcoming shows. the community arts theater in williamsport, pa., posted on its website that the show had been dropped ""due to the recent controversy surrounding kathy griffin and the concern for the safety and security of our patrons and staff."" sen. al franken also dis-invited griffin from an event promoting his new book, ""giant of the senate."" ""after hearing from many minnesotans who were rightfully offended, i've come to the conclusion that it would be best for her not to participate in the event we had previously scheduled,"" the minnesota democrat said thursday, a day after he had said she was still welcome. ""i understand why minnesotans were upset by this, and i take that very seriously."" he said what griffin did ""was inappropriate and not something that should be anywhere in our national discourse."" an endorsement deal with squatty potty also ended. though griffin apologized within hours of the images appearing online tuesday, they were met with swift and widespread condemnation. trump later tweeted that griffin ""should be ashamed of herself"" for posting the images. new jersey gov. chris christie on thursday called griffin ""disgusting"" and said the photo was ""completely outrageous."" even anderson cooper, her cnn co-host for the new year's eve show, condemned the images. griffin said she has not spoken to cooper since, and appeared visibly upset and struggled to speak when fielding questions about cooper. the comic has faced controversies before for her abrasive humor, but none as widespread as the one generated by tuesday's images. this story has been corrected to show that griffin accused the trumps of ""trying to ruin my life forever,"" not ""my rights."" ap writer darlene superville in washington contributed to this story. cnn fires kathy griffin from new year's show after donald trump beheading stunt",1

285,Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Have Seemingly Dropped Their Stealth Act,"for more than four years, rumors have surrounded katie holmes, jamie foxx, and their apparent under-the-radar romance. for a pair of very famous people they’ve managed to avoid the cameras for ages, though in the last year they seemed to be making less of an effort to hide, even spotted in may boarding a private plane in paris, where foxx was filming robin hood. at the same time, tabloids claimed that the two were “ready to go public.” and now, perhaps, that glorious time has come. a photograph on the daily mail captures the two holding hands on the beach in malibu—not exactly walking a red carpet together or making it instagram-official, but the only public display of affection ever witnessed from these two in the wild. the two have been rumored to take secret service-level precautions in their relationship; they reportedly took secret back elevators and cars with tinted windows on dates that seemed more like undercover missions. but in mid-april, a source told us weekly that holmes, who has largely kept her life with her -year-old daughter, suri cruise, private, no longer wanted to play “the hiding game” that she and foxx had mastered since they were first seen together in the late summer of . five years since her divorce from tom cruise, holmes remains a frequent tabloid subject, though her and foxx’s efforts and secrecy have paid off; most headlines focus on her relationship with daughter suri, or maybe her fashion choices, rather than any romance rumors. in february, just before she and foxx began to tease out their public relationship, holmes told town & country that, regardless of what gets printed, she and suri aren’t paying attention anyway. “in today’s world a lot of celebrities probably shield their children from the tabloids; in my household we know what they print isn’t true, so we don’t pay attention.”",1

forged their bond. despite the surreal fame—and baggage—carried by jennifer lopez and alex rodriguez, their relationship makes perfect sense. both started from modest backgrounds, hit the big time fast, and had to battle their own demons to survive. the new couple discuss everything from their nerve-racking first date to the “reveals” that forged their bond. despite the surreal fame—and baggage—carried by jennifer lopez and alex rodriguez, their relationship makes perfect sense. both started from modest backgrounds, hit the big time fast, and had to battle their own demons to survive. the new couple discuss everything from their nerve-racking first date to the “reveals” that forged their bond. ‘it was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn’t normally do,” says jennifer lopez, explaining how she and retired yankee superstar alex rodriguez, who made their red-carpet debut as a couple last spring at the met gala, came to be a modern marilyn monroe and joe dimaggio—that is, if monroe and dimaggio had been happy, highly functional fortysomethings who had apparently done battle with their demons and emerged the victors. it was last winter as she was having lunch in beverly hills that she saw rodriguez walk by. “i almost yelled out ‘alex,’ but i am the shyest person when it comes to things like that,” she says. when she went outside, he was still there, facing away from her. “i could literally just have walked away,” she says. “but i walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say ‘hey.’ “i had just come from a promo for my show, shades of blue , so i’m dressed like my character, like a boy—timberlands, jeans, curly short hair. he looks at me. i say, ‘it’s jennifer.’ he says, ‘you look so beautiful.’ ” she and i are sitting on a stone patio at lopez’s new house in bel air, overlooking an infinity pool and a lush green lawn with a double-size swing, which she points out is perfect for her nine-year-old twins, emme and max. the house is light-filled, sprawling, and warm, with wood-beamed ceilings, stone walls, plush low-slung sofas, big pillows, bowls filled with cut roses, and artwork by collagist peter tunney. “grattitudǝ,” one piece spells out. it’s a portmanteau of “gratitude” and “attitude” that could define lopez. wearing a cropped turtleneck sweater, skinny jeans, high christian louboutin boots, and impressive diamond earrings, she is as startlingly beautiful at  as she was at —if not more so. “we walked into this house, and i said, ‘this is where i want my kids to grow up,’ ” she says. “you have to imagine your life, and what you want to be in it, and i imagined we would be very happy here no matter what.” happy, naturally, has turned out differently from what she imagined. just hours after rodriguez met her in beverly hills, he called her, and they agreed to have dinner a few nights later. she told him that she remembered meeting him on a baseball diamond,  years earlier. her then husband, marc anthony, had thrown out the first pitch of a new york mets game, but the cameras captured lopez and rodriguez shaking hands and locking eyes. “you don’t have to say you remember if you don’t,” she told him. “shea stadium, during a subway series,” he responded. just then, rodriguez walks out of the house to join us on the patio. “i was telling her about the tap,” she says to him. “but there were two taps,” he says. she turns to me. “there was another very significant tap on the shoulder,” she says. before we get to that tap, we talk about their first date, when they met for dinner at the hotel bel air. “he was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!” she says. “i think he thought i was going to be this loud person, but i’m not. i just listen. so he’s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn’t normally talk about on a first date. i don’t know if he thought it was a date. i thought it was a date. then i knew he was nervous because he asked me if i wanted a drink. i said, ‘no, i don’t drink,’ and he asked if i minded if he had one. he was nervous, and it was really cute.” “i didn’t know if it was a date,” rodriguez says. “maybe we were seeing each other at night because of her work schedule. i went in uneasy, not knowing her situation.” he continues: “it would be incredibly productive for me to sit with one of the smartest, greatest women in the world, especially for a guy like me who is coming through tough times, rehabbing himself, re-establishing himself to folks out there. i thought it would be a win-win no matter what.” then: “she told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single,” he says. “i had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. i went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.” “so i’m sitting there and he’s walking back, and i get a text,” lopez continues. “it says . . . ” she looks significantly at rodriguez. “you can tell her!” he says. “ ‘you look sexy af,’ ” she tells me. they both laugh. “and then it took a turn,” lopez says. “the fire alarm went off, and we had to evacuate.” i laugh, thinking she’s being metaphorical. “no, really,” she says. “the fire alarm went off!” but about that other tap. this one was metaphorical. in august , when rodriguez announced his retirement from baseball, with his mother and his daughters natasha and ella in the stands, four runs short of  home runs, he said, “baseball has a funny way of tapping you on the shoulder when you least expect it and telling you that it’s the end.” it’s a year later, and now, he says, “i’m thinking about one door closing and another opening, and if that first door doesn’t close, well, there isn’t that second tap.” rodriguez’s story about the tap is a poignant reminder that this isn’t just another love story. it’s the story of two people with rich and at times tumultuous pasts, which are part of the reason they have a present as a couple. “we are very much twins,” he says. “we’re both leos; we’re both from new york; we’re both latino and about  other things.” “i understand him in a way that i don’t think anyone else could, and he understands me in a way that no one else could ever,” she says. “in his , he came into big success with the biggest baseball contract . i had a no.  movie and a no.  album and made history. we both had ups and downs and challenges in our , and by our  we’d both been through so much. and more importantly than anything, we had both done a lot of work on ourselves.” lopez, whose parents came from puerto rico, grew up in the bronx, where she shared a bedroom with her two sisters. she famously left home at  to make it as a dancer, and burst on the scene in  as one of the fly girls on fox’s in living color, the hit comedy series. she quickly parlayed her luminous beauty, talent, and sheer workaholism into a series of starring roles, including marisa in maid in manhattan, which grossed more than $ million worldwide. of their first date lopez recalls, “i don’t know if he thought it was a date. i thought it was a date. . . . he was nervous, and it was really cute.” being a movie star wasn’t enough for lopez. she also released a string of hit albums and became a fashion icon. in , she signed a lucrative endorsement deal with louis vuitton. “now it’s odd if you’re a celebrity and you don’t serve as the spokesperson for a brand,” says benny medina, her longtime manager, whom lopez credits with seeing the potential of celebrities as brands long before it was commonplace. “but back then there were plenty of snarky comments.” in , lopez was granted a star on the hollywood walk of fame, and the following year she became the first female artist to receive a billboard icon award; her net worth has been estimated at more than $ million. “there are people who put their feet in other people’s footsteps,” says elaine goldsmith-thomas, who was once lopez’s agent and is now a partner in her production company. “jennifer had no footsteps in front of her, so much of the terrain had to be forged.” there was a cost, lopez learned. “when you have that type of success at a young age you have to navigate it, almost survive it,” she says. “i was the first latin actress to ever make $ million from a role, and you feel, oh god, i have to do something great all the time.” there were the inevitable flops (most prominently gigli, her movie with then boyfriend ben affleck) and three failed marriages, the last of which was with marc anthony, the father of her twins. and so her story isn’t just about astounding achievement but also about personal growth and resilience. “i was eviscerated,” she recalls about the press on gigli. “i lost my sense of self, questioned if i belonged in this business, thought maybe i did suck at everything. and my relationship  self-destructed in front of the entire world. it was a two-year thing for me until i picked myself up again.” she has also conquered what was once her biggest fear: being alone. last august, she broke up with dancer casper smart in an effort to learn how. “she’s a seeker,” says her close friend leah remini, the actress and anti-scientology activist. “she’s always trying to improve herself, her relationships, be a better friend, a better daughter, a better mother, a better person. she’s not closed-minded.” if self-doubt and self-reflection aren’t what you’d expect from a diva, it’s striking how little diva there is to lopez these days. goldsmith-thomas, who, in , was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, recalls that lopez would show up for her chemo appointments. “she made me very popular on the chemo ward!,” goldsmith says. “she’d bring clothing for everyone from her sweetface line and she’d rub my bald head and talk about dreams. it was really important to talk about the future because she wanted me to know there was one. that girl saved my life.” rodriguez tells me that lopez is happiest at home, in pj’s, eating chocolate-chip cookies with friends. she and rodriguez like to talk in terms of “reveals”: the unexpected moments that tell you who someone else is. an early one for him, he says, was discovering that lopez was “the role model for health and wellness. she rarely drinks. she tries to get at least eight hours of sleep.” he adds, “that helps explain why she’s so beautiful.” she’s also been willing to take risks to stay relevant, no easy task in a world where female stars are widely believed to have an expiration date. in , she agreed to become a judge on american idol, which some people derided as a comedown. but it worked. “viewers who knew only an attention-grabbing siren met a hardworking, self-made, empathetic single mother,” observed forbes. “no one from my team wanted me to do american idol except benny,” lopez says. “but i felt i had something to offer, and in the back of my mind, i thought, maybe people will get to know me a little bit better.” she adds, “with reality tv, you can’t hide who you are. you just can’t. it’s going to come through.” as lopez was becoming j.lo, so alex rodriguez was becoming a-rod. he was just  and the youngest player in the league when he made his debut with the mariners, in july . he turned in a series of impressive stats that galvanized the baseball world—like becoming the youngest player to hit  home runs. for the  season, he was offered a record-breaking -year $ million contract by the texas rangers. in , rodriguez was traded to the new york yankees, and in  he negotiated another -year deal. like lopez, rodriguez is not a child of privilege. he too was born in new york city. when alex was eight, his parents, immigrants from the dominican republic, moved the family to miami, where his mother became a secretary in an immigration office and waited tables at night. when he was , his dad moved out of the house. as with lopez, success made him feel not comfort and security but a near-desperate drive to succeed even more. (and you can see how questions such as can alex rodriguez prove he’s worth $ million? would foster that attitude in a young athlete.) “my no.  goal was to give r.o.i.  to owners who believed in me,” he recalls. in , his marriage to cynthia scurtis, with whom he had daughters natasha and ella, broke up, due to his relationship with madonna, and his dates with stars from kate hudson to cameron diaz became tabloid fodder. plus, there were the injuries: two major hip surgeries, two knee surgeries. “we’re both like this,” lopez says. “we put so much pressure on ourselves to be great, to be the best all the time. we understood that about each other. when we came together it was ‘oh my god, i was the same way.’ ” rodriguez’s career was ultimately sidelined by the steroid scandal, which rocked major league baseball in the mid-. rodriguez had earlier admitted using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the rangers, but adamantly denied he’d continued the practice while with the yankees. after a protracted fight with both the yankees and the m.l.b., rodriguez was suspended for an entire season—one of the largest penalties in baseball history—in early . “i was hoping the suspension would be shorter,” he says today. “i remember when tony clark, the head of our union, called me and said, ‘it’s a full season—it’s  ,’ it was a knife to my ribs.” rodriguez says he didn’t leave his house for seven days. “i thought i’d played my last game. i grew a beard—as much as i can grow it—and didn’t want to see anyone, including my kids.” i ask him what he learned during that year. “do you have enough time?” he asks. as he talks, lopez nestles into him. “i started brushing myself off, thinking, how do i come back into the world?” he says. the year off, he realized, could give him the chance to heal not just his body but also his mind. “i felt i could work on myself, understand why i kept making mistakes. . . . in a weird way,  will be the best thing that ever happened to me. it forced a paradigm shift.” he continues: “i remember thinking one night . . . don’t know if i told you this, babe  . . . in the middle of this craziness, i remember it’s three a.m., four a.m., and like many nights, i couldn’t sleep. i’m not a crier, but i’m bawling. . . . my pillows are now soaking wet, and it’s the middle of the night, and i’m thinking i’m the only fucking asshole that gets pocket aces and figures out a way to lose the hand. i was so angry at myself, so pissed off, that it was hard to breathe.” “how did you get through?” i ask. “help,” he says. “the work i did, that was one of the most painful and most rewarding experiences of my life, and it continues to this day. i tell myself, ‘i’m rounding first base and going to second base. it’s a process.’ ” he says he decided to do like rocky balboa, to try to make the team “as a broken-down -year-old that didn’t have a lot of allies.” and he succeeded, finishing the season with  home runs. “i did that at  and  percent clean, and no one can take that away from me,” he says. “it told me everything about who i was.” when he retired, he agreed to stay on as an adviser to yankee owner hal steinbrenner and as a mentor to younger players. “from where i came from, that honor is like hitting ,” he says. this, to lopez, was a reveal. “the most impressive thing to me was how he did pick himself up and take that opportunity to make himself a better person,” she says. “the hardest times prove who you are. that’s what i love and admire the most about alex. he doesn’t let anything beat him. he just comes back stronger.” each believes that if they had been single when they met,  years ago, the relationship wouldn’t have worked. “we had to grow and discover ourselves first,” she says. but it also works for another reason. as goldsmith-thomas says, “they weren’t afraid to dream, and they are still dreaming, both of them.” the next night, lopez is performing her smash show all i have in las vegas. onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexy—with a sense of humor—to a festive latin-inspired segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings lee ann womack’s “i hope you dance.” she’s an incandescent performer, partly because, as remini says, “there is nothing jennifer does that she does half-assed. when she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.” “a-rod’s in the house,” someone from the audience yells. she laughs. yes, a-rod is in the house. although he’s seen the show many times, he’s still watching every detail. he nudges me, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to “jenny from the block.” then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch lopez’s feet. during a segment that’s all new york, with lopez in a sequined baseball jersey, he nudges me again. “if you look closely, you’ll see what number she’s wearing on her jersey,” he says. it’s , his yankee number. he says, “we are very much twins.” she says, “i understand him in a way that i don’t think anyone else could.” earlier that day, she and rodriguez were in los angeles at the premiere event for this season’s shark tank, in which rodriguez will be the first latino shark. at a panel where the sharks discussed the show, the investor and dallas mavericks owner mark cuban says, “a lot of us were pleasantly surprised that when alex came in, he knew his stuff cold.” during the red-carpet interviews, lopez, who is impossibly glamorous in a floor-length tweed coat and aviator sunglasses, hangs at the back of the crowd. “does it feel weird to be in the background?” i ask. “noooo,” she says. “i like it. because i’m out there enough. some people, it wouldn’t work—they can’t stand not being the one in the spotlight. but not us.” their story is also a merger of business empires. lopez, who back in —way before everyone else was becoming an entrepreneur—launched her fragrance glow by j.lo, now has a big portfolio of business interests, which range from her production company to sprawling property holdings. rodriguez seems to slot right into her world. from a young age, he sought out mentors who could help him build a business that would one day replace his baseball income. during his suspension year, he took investing classes at columbia and marketing classes at the university of miami. today, a-rod corp is an investment firm focused on a broad array of industries, including real estate, sports and wellness, media, and entertainment. “i don’t have your traditional formal education,” he says. “mine comes through reading and passion and grit and collecting a lot of information from my mentors. i’ve never been afraid to say, ‘i don’t know. can you explain that to me?’ that’s echoed by hedge-fund billionaire marc lasry, who has invested with rodriguez for the last decade. “what’s interesting about alex is that he’s a sponge,” lasry says. “he really wants to learn.” another mentor of sorts is mary callahan erdoes, the c.e.o. of j.p. morgan asset & wealth management, who met rodriguez around the time that lasry did. “you might be expecting something different,” she says. “but from the first day, he had his notebook out. he’s incredibly curious and serious. there’s no nonsense and no pomp and circumstance.” that’s true to this day, erdoes says, whether he’s attending a jpmorgan-hosted conference on brexit or a meeting with a hedge-fund manager. “he sits in the front of the room with his notebook out and his hand up, asking questions,” she says. rodriguez’s innate curiosity—about business, about other people, about fresh concepts—makes him stand out in a world where many people lack that trait. “the real reason people do deals with alex is that they like him and he’s smart,” says lasry. the day after i saw lopez’s show in las vegas, we meet at one of rodriguez’s latest investments, which he discovered when he was looking for a place to work out in las vegas—members of lopez’s crew had raved about it. called trufusion, it offers more than  styles of instruction and  to  daily classes in yoga, pilates, kettlebell exercises, and battle-rope workouts in heated rooms. last june, rodriguez purchased a major stake in the company, and now owns the development rights for all of florida. president and c.o.o. jonathan fornaci says the classes can be so hard that he sees some professional athletes take breaks during them, but “alex kills it. and immediately afterward he’s drilling down, asking questions that any private-equity analyst would be asking.” i’m warned that the “down n dirty bootcamp” will be hard and sweaty, and it is precisely as advertised. at one point, confused by the welter of instructions—left! right! kettlebell! weight! sandbag!—i look over at lopez and roll my eyes in desperation. “i get confused, too,” she says. “just watch everyone else.” during some particularly brutal leg lifts, i give up. she does not. in fact, she starts singing. at the end, we’re all sitting on our mats, drenched in sweat and exhausted. journey’s “don’t stop believin”’ is playing. it’s clear as day that neither of them is hitting pause. after vegas, she’s off to new york, where her children are in school, and he’s off to atlanta, where he’s filming a pilot for a cnbc reality show that will help retired athletes who are struggling financially. rodriguez says he keeps himself grounded with some key words: “gratitude and appreciation. when someone offers me a job, i thank the lord that i have work, and i beg for more work.” and he adds, “we’re really good at reminding each other.” they begin to tell me a story, one in which lopez is in the bath, and rodriguez is sitting by the fire in a robe. looking at my face, he starts laughing. “you’re like, ‘where are you going with this story, and is it going to get r-rated?’ ” but it’s not r-rated, not at all. he says he got hot from the fire and went to sit on the patio outside their room, with a book and his feet up, in the crisp air. lopez breaks in. “i came out and said, ‘what are you doing out here?’ he said, ‘living the dream.’ ” it’s clear from the story that he said it in a way that was free of irony. “i thought, wow, this person is different,” lopez says. “because a lot of people i’ve met in my life, they don’t appreciate what they’re doing and how amazing it is . . . not the greatness of the house, but the moment of sitting there with someone you love, with a family, with healthy kids.” all over the house are pictures of their four children as one family; when i ask rodriguez which of his businesses he’s most passionate about, he responds, without missing a beat, “my daughters.” as we drive from trufusion to a little restaurant in a vegas strip mall called greens and proteins, they say that early in their relationship they’d text each other using the hashtag #bloodinbloodout, after the mexican gangster film that is in some ways about the unbreakable ties of family. at the restaurant, a few people turn and stare, but mostly we’re ignored, probably because no one can quite believe it’s them. he’s in workout clothes; she’s wearing a cropped pink sweatshirt, no makeup, and has her hair pulled back in a bun. when we sit down, rodriguez asks what surprised me the most about spending time with them. i answer that i was surprised, even shocked, by their genuine interest in other people. but when i walked behind them as they left trufusion, their hands were touching and they were talking intently. it was normal and natural and easy. and that’s an even better answer: i’m most surprised to see that, out of two often surreal lives, they are managing to make one wonderfully real life. our essential brief on culture, the news, and more. and it's on the house.",1
287,Kylie Jenner's Plastic Surgeon Has a Message About Her Lip Fillers,"while the internet hunts for clues about kylie jenner's maybe pregnancy (along with khloé kardashian's maybe pregnancy and kim kardashian's confirmed pregnancy), at least one person has wondered, what of the reality star's famous lip fillers? naturally, the question comes from kylie's plastic surgeon, dr. simon ourian. in an interview with page six — which, aside, has a terrible and patronizing headline — dr. ourian shared, ""i recommend that women stop getting lip fillers as soon as they learn they are pregnant. no one knows the implications of lip fillers on pregnant patients since dermal fillers haven’t been tested on pregnant women."" he added, ""i would never knowingly administer lip injections to a pregnant patient. in fact, it is my policy not to perform any procedures at all on pregnant women."" dr. ourian also cautioned, ""if a woman receives lip fillers before becoming pregnant, the results can last several months into her pregnancy, especially if she received one of the newer longer-lasting fillers. additionally, many women experience naturally increased lip size during pregnancy due to increased levels of estrogen, blood flow, fluids, and swelling caused by pregnancy, regardless of whether they ever received lip fillers previously."" kylie, for her part, has remained mum on whether she's becoming a mom. her latest social media posts do have to do with her pout though — namely, her new kylie cosmetics fall lip kits, which are also getting an accompanying purple eyeshadow palette: ""welcome #thepurplepalette to the @kyliecosmetics family this beauty launches next week .. at  pst only on kyliecosmetics.com!""",1

292,"Ellen DeGeneres Talks Feelings, Fun and Finding Dory","ellen degeneres is a lot like the cartoon fish she gives life to in disney/pixar’s finding dory, opening june . much like dory, whom we met in the hit  movie finding nemo, degeneres, , is undaunted, kind, strong and loving, swimming on despite the obstacles in her way. but unlike dory, whose amnesia causes her to remember almost nothing, degeneres remembers a whole lot. the native of metairie, louisiana, hasn’t forgotten the slow road to fame in the  and how her first prime-time comedy series, ellen, was abandoned by advertisers and the tv network when it flopped, capsized in part by backlash and negative response to her “coming out” as tv’s highest-profile lesbian. like dory, she swam on. she went back to doing stand-up comedy, created her own afternoon-tv talk show and hosted the emmys, grammys and the academy awards—twice. in , degeneres married australian actress/model portia de rossi, . both vegans, they share a passion for animal rights, environmental causes and renovating houses. parade’s dotson rader met with degeneres in her office on the back lot of the tv studio complex in burbank, california, where the ellen degeneres show has been produced for  years. what was your childhood like? was it fun? i grew up in a very conservative home. my father was a first reader in the christian science church, which is similar to being a preacher. there was no drinking, smoking or cursing. i didn’t see deep emotion from my parents. it was all very polite and very surface. i never knew how anybody was feeling. because of that religion everything was fine all the time. isn’t it dishonest to pretend you’re happy when you’re really angry? exactly. i never saw anyone angry—so when i was  and my parents divorced it was a huge surprise to me because i was told everything was fine. it was very confusing. that’s not a healthy way to grow up. it was very hard to express yourself. a kid should be told that you can have feelings. i have a lot of feelings. you can feel sad and angry and hurt. but the only feeling that was approved of is happiness—that was it. how can you have happiness when you’re not honest? how did that emotional repression affect you? as a young girl, i noticed things a lot more. i started seeing that things weren’t completely as everyone said they were. i noticed everything because i had to after my parents divorced. at , i sort of became the parent, taking care of my mother. did that experience influence your comedy? i think my comedy came from observing little details in life. what is most important are the details, not the broad strokes but noticing what’s in between. one of my first jokes was the fact that when somebody tastes something disgusting, they always want you to taste it too, like, “this is disgusting—taste it!” and people do. why could you see what others never saw? because i was very tender. i was very sensitive, and i still am. i never want to hurt anybody. i want to make people laugh. i didn’t think it was ever funny to make fun of people. there’s so much to laugh at without it being at someone else’s expense. you end each tv show by telling your viewers to be kind to each other. why is kindness so important to you? because i’ve been treated in a way that has not been kind, respectful or considerate. i learned compassion from having experienced some bad stuff. after your parents divorced, you stayed alone with your mom in new orleans? yes. my mother was going through a hard time. she dated lots of really horrible men and had bad experiences. she went from being my mother to being somebody i was watching date men. at , it’s a weird thing. then she remarried and had breast cancer right away, a really tough thing for her. i had to make her laugh.  started from me trying to make her happy. it felt really good to have power to make people happy. that’s my talent. not that i thought i’d make money from it. you have an older brother, vance. what happened to him? he left, angry. he was . he didn’t want to live with either parent. he was in a band. now we’re very, very close. he’s great. he is very talented and works with my production company. you went to the university of new orleans for less than a semester and dropped out. why? school just was not interesting to me. before ellen was ellen: do you remember her  best tv appearances? were you surprised when abc abruptly canceled your hit sitcom after your character came out? it was a sucker punch. i didn’t expect it. i knew that there was a big chance that this was the end of my career. but i’m grateful for it. i got to start over again and create this talk show. there are people who don’t know about the sitcoms, or my stand-up comedy. they think i’m just a talk show host. that’s fine with me. on your talk show, everything is positive, despite what may be happening that’s bad in the real world, say in politics. i don’t do political humor. i never have. trump is being attacked by everybody because it’s an easy thing to do. stephen colbert goes after him every night and so does jimmy fallon, jimmy kimmel. a lot of people do. i don’t. i don’t want to make fun of anybody. it’s not who i am. get a peek at ellen’s quirky design style in her new book home your show seems unrelentingly happy. it is a happy show, on purpose. i represent happiness to a lot of people. i want to keep myself as open and as nonjudgmental as possible. before the show was picked up, i think a lot of station managers thought i would have an agenda to try to somehow turn the world gay. people did worry. our only agenda is to make people feel good. it’s an hour of joy. your audience squeals with excited delight a lot. there are people from all over the world who wait three years for tickets. i was in dubai and this woman said she’d been trying to get tickets for five years. that’s why i created the room  leftover people who can’t get in. tom hanks named it the riff raff room. you live a very public life with a lot of pressures, among them rumors of marital problems with your wife, portia. i don’t pay attention . but we’ve been followed recently by the paparazzi, and we found out it’s because there’s a story out there that we’re getting divorced. we don’t know why. we’re together all the time. we genuinely love each other. her happiness is my happiness, and vice versa. true love is caring more about the other person’s happiness than your own.",1

294,Aid worker claims Angelina Jolie adopted son Maddox using fake details,"a cambodian aid worker is making extraordinary claims about angelina jolie's  adoption of eldest son maddox jolie-pitt. mounh sarath, , told britain's the sun on sunday that he signed official papers in cambodia claiming he was maddox's father in order to help speed along the boy's adoption all those years ago. he also claims he still has legal power of attorney over the now-teenager and showed the sun on sunday the adoption document filed with a court in cambodia's battambong province in august  to back up his claims. he explained the lie, telling the paper, ""she had to change his name, so the only way was for me to do it. i said he's my son."" ""in court documents, maddox is still my son,"" he said. ""she never cleared this up."" despite his claims, there is no evidence that either angelina, , or then-husband billy bob thornton,  -- who was also involved in maddox's adoption before he and angelina divorced -- knew what mounh did. according to mailonline, angelina has previously said she went to ""great lengths to ensure maddox did not have a living birth mother in cambodia"" and that she would ""never rob a mother of her child."" maddox's adoption took place at a time when the united states was imposing tougher restrictions on adopting kids from cambodia because of trafficking concerns. lauryn galindo -- the adoption agent who handled angelina and maddox's case -- spent time in prison after reportedly falsifying the names, birth dates and birth places of cambodian children who were adopted by americans.

""and from then on, the press were on me all the time,"" lohan said. ""it was the first time i'd taken drugs. i was out in a club with people i shouldn't have been with, and took cocaine, and got in the car. it was so stupid."" her first rehab visit was not because of drugs or alcohol but to help her deal with the trauma she experienced making a movie, she told morgan. she voluntary checked into the wonderland center in los angeles while she was shooting ""i know who killed me"" in january . ""i was having really bad nightmares, and the movie was pretty traumatizing,"" lohan said. ""so i stayed in a facility so i could get some sleep and talk about it with someone the next day, because it was overwhelming. but i would leave every day and just sleep there at night. i liked that. it was kind of like having my own live-in therapist, because i was having crazy nightmares and i was having aa meetings on set and stuff. it really helped."" she had been drinking for less than a year at that point, lohan said. she stayed away from alcohol after her first hangover experience at , when her mother made her ""sleep with vomit still on me so i'd understand how it felt,"" she said. ""i was too scared!"" she was a good teenager, she said. ""my friends and i would actually pretend to be drunk,"" she said. ""and it was more fun. i never rebelled against my parents -- i worked hard, i was responsible and i didn't go to high-school parties."" she doesn't consider herself to be an alcoholic -- ""i've never woken up in the morning and had a drink"" -- but ""when i was younger, i was definitely going out too much and i was drinking too much."" lohan considers herself an expert on rehab facilities. ""i've been court-ordered to do it six times,"" she said. ""i could write the book on rehab. constantly sending me to rehab is pointless. the first few times i was court-ordered to rehab, it was like a joke, like killing time."" morgan interviewed her before the confusion erupted over which rehab facility she would enter. after arriving at one -- which california officials said was unlicensed -- she left for the betty ford clinic, where she spent her last and longest rehab stay. ""i look at it as a good thing,"" she said about this rehab visit.

""this is where it gets hard for me to explain,"" she said. ""i don't think there's anything wrong with people taking time to just be by themselves. i think people want to see me do that. they will keep saying the same things about me if i don't. i don't think it will be a bad thing for me to be away with myself for three months."" although now confessing to morgan that she used drugs a year ago, she told matt lauer on nbc's ""today"" show a year ago that that she was ""clean and sober"" then for ""a long time."" although she was once arrested for cocaine possession and later sent to rehab when she violated probation by testing positive for the drug, lohan said she rarely used it since ""i don't like it.""

""i have made out with girls before, and i had a relationship with a girl. but i think i needed to experience that and i think i was looking for something different."" ""i like being in a relationship with a guy,"" lohan said.

315,Why Can't Jessie J Be Bi?,"singer jessie j, , is in the news because of her sexuality again. but this time, it's not because of something the out and outspoken bi artist has done. just the opposite. this time, it's because of something an unofficial biographer says she hasn't done. and that thing is: have sex with men. chloe govan says that jessie j is not bisexual -- even though she herself identifies that way -- but is in fact a lesbian. the ""proof,"" according to the biographer, is the ""fact"" that she hasn't dated men since she was . that's seven whole years of being only with women. but i'm confused. does bisexuality come with an expiration date? here are some facts that govan may not be aware of: according to research from the williams institute, the leading lgbt demographic research organization in the world, there are twice as many women who identify as bisexual as there are women who identify as lesbian. that means, among women date women, the odds are two to one that a woman is out as bi. according to lesbian professor dr. lisa diamond, one of the leading scholars on women's sexuality, lesbian and bisexual women more often have fluid, complex, varied sexual histories than linear, static ones. bisexual women -- and lesbians -- may be ""/"" (in terms of experiences with men and women), they may have long periods of time being with just one gender, and they may even be life-long monogamists who are only ever with one person of one gender. all of that can fall under the umbrella of women who use the word ""bisexual"" to describe themselves. and according to lesbian professor dr. paula rust, the vast majority of lesbians have had sex with men, both before and after coming out as lesbians. in fact, in the lesbian community, it's so widely known that most lesbians sleep with men that there's even a term for the very few who don't: gold-star. a gold-star lesbian is a lesbian who has never been with a man. so, if lesbians can -- and do -- sleep with men, and still call themselves lesbians, then why can't a bisexual woman not sleep with men, and still call herself bi? if women who identify as bisexual can have enormous variety in their sexual histories, why can't jessie j be bi? and if there are twice as many bi women as lesbians, why can't jessie j be bi? research from the williams institute also shows that bisexuals tend to be younger than lesbians. jessie j is  years old. why can't she be bi? govan says that jessie j was forced to say she's bi by music executives, even though she's really a lesbian, because bisexuality would be more appealing to her audience. but according to dr. gregory herek, the leading researcher on stigma, bisexual women are much more stigmatized than lesbians. research also shows that bisexual women are more likely than lesbians -- and straight women -- to be victims of domestic violence. this means that bisexual women are considered less appealing and are more attacked. (all of which is extremely disturbing, and has been the subject of much of my other writing.) my point is: this ""bisexuality will draw a bigger audience"" trope is bullshit. one of jessie j's most famous songs is called ""do it like a dude."" around the internet, this song is getting bandied about as further ""proof"" that she's a lesbian. but first of all, why can't bisexual women be masculine, too? and why must lesbians always be? some of the most masculine women i know are bi, and some of the most feminine ones i know are lesbians. second of all, when you read the lyrics, you see that it's actually a song about a butch woman at a bar who turns on men by being her masculine self. the lyrics say, ""boom, boom, pour me a beer/ no pretty drinks, i'm a guy out here"" and later, ""boys, come say what you wanna... boys, gettin' hot under the collar."" why can't that bi? in fact, how is it not bi? and finally, why can't jessie j be bi just because she says she is? why is it that when a celebrity comes out as a lesbian, i don't read that she's actually really secretly bi, but was pressured by her handlers to say she's gay, but when someone comes out as bi, i see this kind of thing over and over again? why is female bisexuality so unbelievable to people, and why must a woman's statement about her own (bi)sexuality be discredited? how hard is it to just take a woman's word for it, when she talks about her (bi)sexuality? why can't jessie j be bi?",1

""every day at lunch the entire cast and crew head to a cafeteria facility where they all sit down and eat lunch together for well over an hour,"" a source told radaronline. ""but the only person who doesn't eat with everyone else is jen. she quickly grabs a lunch to go and leaves."" according to radaronline's source, aniston also gets a fancier suv than everyone else's (including fellow stars isla fisher and tim robbins) and her trailer is situated way off set. all of these things make her seem ""not approachable,"" according to radaronline. but we can't help but wonder ... is she being a obnoxious, or is she really just trying to hide a pregnancy? think about it: pregnancy gives you weird cravings but also nausea (hence the lonesome lunches), and perhaps she doesn't want to undress in front of others who can catch a glimpse of her baby bump. or maybe we're just really, really wishful thinkers. either way, this is not the first time aniston has had ""diva"" rumors attached to her. a year and a half ago she admitted to throwing a chair at a director (!) but for a worthy cause: the man treated the script supervisor poorly and jen later explained she couldn't stand aside and let him go on with it.",1

322,How Janet Jackson lost 70 pounds,"the -year-old new mom is sporting a sleek physique that her trainer says she accomplished without putting in massive hours of cardio, reportedly shedding  pounds. ""we were training a minimum of four times a week, and the sessions were never less than  minutes, no more than an hour,"" sybliss said. ""very intense though, very intense training."" and while jackson was intent on shedding her pregnancy pounds, sybliss said she focused the training on adding lean muscle to her client to help her be in her best shape for the concert tour. the trainer said they did back-to-back weight exercises rather than cardio to get jackson's heart rate up and to help her burn fat. ""what that does -- you would look at her and think she'd done like an hour of cardio with me -- but when you're working with weights and you're working the muscle that way, it elevates the heart rate, but also it's creating that fat-burning effect, both during the session and also when she left me, and that was key,"" sybliss said. as for diet, sybliss said she believes moderation is the key, and she doesn't sweat her clients about cheating every now and then.

324,This Is What Justin Bieber Did Instead of Going to the Grammys,"despite earning four nominations for his album purpose, justin bieber had no plans to attend the grammy awards this year. rather than sitting at home alone, however, he decided to go out for sushi, and took fans along for the ride on his instagram story. (other bystanders captured a few snaps of him walking into the restaurant as well for a full -degree look at what it's like to have dinner with justin.) of course, this move is a statement, and not a subtle one at that. tmz reportedly spoke to a source that said justin ""doesn't think the grammys are relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers."" regardless, choosing not to show up to an award show for which you have received multiple nominations, and then to highlight that fact by doing something so overtly casual is pretty suspect. however, this wasn't the only questionable act that went down on justin's instagram live feed this weeknd. he also posted a video in which you hear someone ask him, ""favorite song at the moment?"" he pauses, and then replies: ""'starboy,' by the weeknd,"" before bursting out into laughter, making it clear that the comment was sarcastic. you then hear the second voice in the video say: ""we've gotta end it now. that was too funny."" but we beg to differ, especially as it's not the first time justin's taken a swipe at his fellow artist - and it's that consistency that is concerning. this past january, he called the weeknd's music ""whack,"" so we already knew he wasn't exactly a fan. it's a significant comment mostly because it appears to be a bitter snide from an ex. as we all know, selena gomez has been spotted with the weeknd, and though their relationship hasn't been officially confirmed, there's enough evidence – justin's response included – to speculate that the two are an item. dissing a fellow artist for no reason- and especially when the question posed was open-ended and positive - isn't cool. doing it to your ex's new partner is as petty as petty gets. if nothing else, it's shown us that justin has more #feelings about the situation than we realized.",1

331,Keeping Up With Kendall Jenner,"when it was announced last week that kendall jenner would be the new face of estée lauder, a coveted contract that in the past has gone to actresses like gwyneth paltrow and elizabeth hurley and supermodels like joan smalls, the company did not promote the news by way of the usual public-relations machine, with news releases or email blasts. instead, after vogue broke the story on its website, in anticipation of a -page spread in the magazine, ms. jenner was encouraged to tell the public herself, on her own instagram account. that post quickly garnered more than a million ""likes,"" ,-plus comments and many, many heart-eyed emoji. it was the latest plum appointment for ms. jenner, , a daughter of kris and bruce jenner, and a half sister to kim, khloé and kourtney kardashian. her seemingly meteoric rise over the last few years has taken her from a sulky minor player on the sometimes cringe-inducing but highly successful reality show ""keeping up with the kardashians"" to a tentative career as a teenage model to the runways of the major fashion shows (chanel, marc jacobs and givenchy, among them). along the way, she has all but redefined what it takes to become a high-profile model. ms. jenner is tall, dark-haired, doe-eyed and beautiful. but so are hundreds of other girls who walk the runways of new york, milan and paris and thousands more who dream of one day doing so. what they don't have are ms. jenner's  million followers on instagram, . million on twitter and . million likes on facebook (numbers that will surely have grown by the time you read this). like many other -year-old girls, she uses these accounts to share photos of herself, her family and friends. unlike many -year-old girls, she also uses them to plug her many partnerships and commercial projects. ""i think what's so exciting about her is that she has this social media influence along with a fashion credibility in a distinct way that speaks to millennials,"" said jane hertzmark hudis, the global brand president of estée lauder. ""there is really no one else like her out there."" like her older siblings, with their retail stores, fragrance lines, nail polishes and more, ms. jenner juggles multiple brand extensions premised on her family fame. with her younger sister, kylie, she is marketing a collection of clothes and accessories for pacsun, one of shoes for steve madden's madden girl line and a science-fiction young adult novel set in a dystopian future colony called indra. but the kardashian affiliation that first brought her to the world's attention has put her on a peculiar perch: followed by millions but navigating aversion in a cloistered industry accustomed to minting its own stars, and a historically wary - but steadily warming - relationship with the kardashian family. (ms. jenner's agent and several of her clients, including ms. hudis, claimed not to watch ""keeping up with the kardashians,"" now filming its  season.) ""it's definitely two different worlds. i feel like hannah montana. but it's fun,"" ms. jenner said, referring to miley cyrus's character, who navigates a double life in and out of the spotlight, on the disney sitcom that began her career and pop stardom. (of course, both of ms. jenner's worlds are squarely in the public eye.) for modeling purposes, and with a touch of wishful thinking, ms. jenner prefers to go by simply ""kendall."" in person, she is charming but terse, with a daffy sweetness if not necessarily the gift of gab. when she presented at the  billboard music awards, she famously muffed her lines, dissolving into giggles and admitting, ""guys, i'm the worst reader."" at a fitting at marc jacobs's office - during which a crowd of teenage girls gathered outside of the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of her - she was taken with a publicist's striking eye color. ""are those your real eyes?"" she asked. she arrived for a recent interview at her agency's office dressed model-casual: céline slip-on sneakers, a black t-shirt and skinny pants (tag still on) by which designer she wasn't sure. they had shown up unbidden at her house, like much else, a perk not every model enjoys. she is the first to acknowledge that she was not always interested in style. ""on season  of our show, i would wear, like, neon green jeans and a white polo shirt, the craziest things,"" she said, though in her defense, when ""keeping up with the kardashians"" premiered in , ms. jenner was  years old. she called modeling a lifelong dream. ""i would literally sit at home and have my friends take pictures of me on my little canon camera that my mom gave me for christmas,"" she said. ""obviously, the show was me being in front of a camera. it's just something that i've kind of always been around."" initial forays into modeling were small in scale. in , ms. jenner appeared in the new york fashion week show of sherri hill, a designer from austin, tex., who specializes in event and prom dresses. earlier that year, ms. jenner's appearance at a shoot of ms. hill's dresses had been a plot point on an episode of ""keeping up with the kardashians."" but ms. jenner's role on the show had largely been as a sidekick to her scenery-chewing sisters. with a new agency, the society management, specializing in high-end fashion bookings, behind her, ms. jenner is now working to rebrand. ""we had to be very strategic and specific,"" she said, ""to really have people take me seriously and not mess around."" the perceived divide between commercial and high fashion is so wide that, when asked whether ms. jenner's well-documented sherri hill appearance had been her new york fashion week debut, a society representative declined to confirm, writing, ""we recall her as still being in school during that period."" with a name like hers, fairly or not, there have been detractors for as long as there have been supporters. ""it always comes as a shock when i tell the story of how i casted kendall,"" riccardo tisci wrote in an email about his decision to use ms. jenner in his givenchy show and ad campaign. ""i didn't do it because of my links to her sister or to kanye, as everyone seems to believe. i only chose kendall because i thought she was amazing, a striking, dark, edgy beauty, exactly the way i like them."" even with prominent advocates, ms. jenner's rise was freighted with uncertainty. ""her agent was very aware that she had one shot at being a credible model,"" said the stylist and love magazine editor katie grand, an early champion, who in february orchestrated ms. jenner's return to new york fashion week by placing her in marc jacobs's show. when the society first asked her to consider ms. jenner, ms. grand was reluctant. ""i didn't even really know who she was other than someone i thought went skiing with harry styles once,"" she said, alluding to ms. jenner's alleged former beau. (the rumor mill has linked ms. jenner to mr. styles, of one direction, and justin bieber, among others.) ms. grand said her first reaction was ""underwhelmed."" ms. jenner's shyness can read as standoffish, and she is still developing the presence that can distinguish a top model. even today on the runway, she can often blend into the endless parade of willowy but indeterminable young women, without the identifiable prowl of a model like karlie kloss, or the seasoned charisma of one like naomi campbell. ms. jenner's agent begged for one more appointment. on a follow-up visit, ms. grand found her less shy, more spirited and ambitious. ""there's lots of people that i've worked with at a time before they kicked into the fashion world or fashion consciousness,"" she said. ""marc is very aware of that, because we've worked together for so long. he kind of humors me a bit. it's always a bit of an eye glaze and 'really? are we really going to do that?' "" they did. mr. jacobs, initially skeptical, came around, largely because, ms. grand said, ""she looked really good in the clothes."" the reaction, thanks in no small part to the look ms. jenner wore - which included a breast-baring, sheer top - was immediate. ""i was in a car on the way to the airport immediately after the show to go to london,"" ms. grand said. ""i was just looking through twitter and it was everywhere. i think i didn't really realize it would be such a thing."" but despite the ensuing cacophony (not only from fashion blogs, but also the daily mail, fox news and more), ms. jenner kept a limited schedule that season, walking only for mr. jacobs, mr. tisci, giles deacon in london (another ms. grand client) and karl lagerfeld at chanel. more followed. she appeared in chanel's couture show in july and on the cover of ms. grand's love magazine. during the spring  season in september, she expanded her show list to add diane von furstenberg, tommy hilfiger and dolce & gabbana, among others. she is one of a handful of models in the new karl lagerfeld spring ad campaign, and is said to be in spring ads for marc jacobs as well. (michael ariano, a representative for marc jacobs, said he could neither confirm nor deny this.) although she said she was happiest to go unrecognized at castings and shows - even, in one case, being asked by a makeup artist, ""did you know kendall jenner is here?"" - the media has noted her every appearance, and stoked rumors. in touch weekly reported that other models, threatened by ms. jenner's ascendancy, taunted her by putting out cigarettes in her drink. (ms. jenner's representatives dispute this.) ok! magazine splashed a runway shot and a photo of a weeping kim across its cover under the headline, ""kendall: 'i'm the hot one now!' "" there are those in the industry who resent the intrusion of celebrity into the hermetic runway world, though ms. jenner's high profile largely ensures that they complain privately rather than publicly. ms. jenner is not the only model to make the leap - her friends gigi hadid, a daughter of the ""real housewife of beverly hills"" yolanda foster, and hailey baldwin, a daughter of stephen baldwin, have, too - but she is the most famous. photo ms. jenner. credit bon duke for the new york times ms. jenner's dual citizenship, as it were, in the realms of fashion and celebrity is a decisive factor in her appeal. after the announcement of her estée lauder campaign, social media responded, both in favor of ms. jenner's appointment and opposed to it. ""@esteelauder have you lost your mind..."" asked one user on twitter. ""do you really understand your customer base... where did you pluck kendall jenner from""? but its executives know both who their customers are - in the united states and europe, women as close to kris jenner's age as to kendall's - and who they hope new ones might be. according to data provided by the company, on the saturday of the announcement, estéelauder.com received six times the number of unique visitors as on an average saturday. within  hours of the announcement,  percent of visitors to the site were first-timers,  percent viewing the site on a mobile device. ""it speaks volumes to where we are right now in terms of nontraditional media,"" said chris gay, the general manager of the society, of the estée lauder campaign. ""millennials are not into traditional media. how they're getting their media is completely fractured."" as models have gone from muses to marketing partners, their social presences, global reach and audience engagement have become a more important part of their appeal. ""there's no q ratings for models,"" mr. gay said, referring to q scores, a measurement of consumer awareness of and favorability toward brands, characters and personalities. ""that was never part of the equation. but now you have real analytics."" (the q scores company does in fact track a number of models. ms. jenner has an awareness percentage of  among the general population, which puts her in line with actresses like kerry washington, and only  percentage points below gisele bündchen, the world's highest-paid model. her q score, measuring the percentage of respondents who called her one of their favorites, is  to ms. bündchen's .) ms. jenner's friend olivier rousteing, the creative director of balmain, depended less on analytics than personal experience when he decided, after spending time with her at kim kardashian and kanye west's wedding, to cast her in his spring show. but he was not insensitive to the pull she exerts on young women worldwide. ""she's really communicating to a lot of girls,"" he said. ""you know, like those models in the , claudia, naomi - young girls were dreaming of being a model. i think kendall is bringing these things. girls are dreaming about how to be her."" ms. jenner did not care to parse the various interpretations the world has offered on her rise. ""some people are hesitant with me, and they just worry or wonder for a second,"" she said. ""but then when the chance gets taken . ...""",1

333,The Mystery of How Kendall Met the Hadids Has Been Solved,"not too long ago kendall jenner and gigi hadid were just two young, unconnected girls who occasionally appeared on their family members' reality television show. then the world blinked and all the sudden they were burgeoning supermodels and super influencers. then the world blinked again and they were bonafide supermodel bffs. another blink and their sisters, kylie and bella, were also burgeoning influence and burgeoning models in their own right. one more blink and they're now four of the most famous young women on the entire planet and they all hang out with each other in various groupings and form the core of one of the most powerful girl squads in the entire world. of this we all know, and, yet, what we did not know is how any of them actually came to actually know each other and became friends in the first place. there were simple guesses: kendall and gigi just met on the fashion circuit and took a liking to one another. there were more complicated guesses based on the fact that the two pairs of sisters are sort of ""related"" in the way that all european royal families are sort of related—through a complicated string of marriages and divorces. the story: before kris jenner, the jenners' father caitlyn—née bruce—used to be married to a woman named linda, and after their divorce linda married the composer david foster. linda and david also got divorced, and then the hadids' mother yolanda married david after her first marriage to the sisters' biological father mohamed. naturally, yolanda and david are now divorced as well. so, maybe some assumed they just met at a very awkward extended family reunion, of sorts. as it happens, that is not the case. earlier this year came a stunning new clue in the mystery. while everyone thought that it was kendall and gigi who were the original nexus of the friendship web, it turned out that kendall was actually friends with bella first. now, finally, after far too long spent thinking about this, we have a definitive answer and it is way, way more mundane and even a bit geekier than we ever imagined. ""i met her for the first time seven years ago over twitter,"" bella told instyle . “that was before we started modeling; i was probably  or . we met up and had sushi, and now we’re best friends. she’s a pretty significant human i met online.” while there is still shame in this world about admitting you've met anyone online, the fact that two of the most popular girls in the world did so back when they were "" or "" should satisfy everyone, and, once and for all, any questions about how the jenners met the hadids.",1

341,Paul McCartney Is Not Dead (And Neither Is the Past),"this january marks the tenth anniversary of the beatles' appearance on the american charts. last month rolling stone conducted its first full-scale interview with paul mccartney, in six sessions starting in a london recording studio and ending on a new york street. the new york sessions took place the day after mccartney had entered the us for the first time in two years, visa problems stemming from two marijuana violations now finally resolved. mccartney was cautious in his responses during the first two sessions. he and linda remembered being on vacation in scotland when they were first shown john lennon's lengthy interview (rolling stone number  and number , january  and february , ), and having been deeply hurt by it. at first he seemed to want to avoid the kind of controversy lennon's interview had generated but in later conversations he became freer with his answers. because the various sessions were necessarily disconnected, our text does not follow in all cases the actual sequence of questions. for example, mccartney's discussion of his legal difficulties is compiled from three separate conversations. one of those discussions was prompted by an incident on a new york street. we were walking down  street towards the new york office of eastman and eastman, attorneys – lee and john eastman, father and brother of linda mccartney (whose photographs illustrate this interview). a man in a gray suit with a colorful umbrella approached mccartney and asked, ""mr. mccartney? this is for you."" it was an american copy of a process from allen klein that had been served on paul two weeks before in london. an outraged pr man howled; mccartney smiled and told the man, ""thank you very much."" he was being sarcastic. the villain of the scenario, so far as he was concerned, was not the man in the gray suit, but klein himself, whom mccartney calls a ""punk."" mccartney claims he sued his fellow ex-beatles in high court because it was the only way to sue klein. when we queried the head of abkco industries about the suit, he seemed to relish the new confrontation. ""he now has the opportunity to say anything he wants in court,"" klein told us. ""he has his opportunity to fight me face to face. i am welcoming it. now he's in the same ring with me. isn't that what he wanted?"" john eastman made this statement concerning the beatles/apple/klein suits and paul's involvement in them: ""john lennon, george harrison, ringo starr, yoko ono, apple and others started an action in england against abkco and klein. this complaint alleges abkco and klein took excessive commissions, practiced fraud, suggested conduct which would have been a fraud on the tax authorities in the us and uk, mismanaged bangla desh and otherwise mismanaged the affairs of the complainant. this action is now pending against abkco and klein. ""abkco then sued lennon, harrison, starr, yoko ono, apple and other related companies in the us. it claims damages against them of $,,. plus future earnings. ""abkco also joined paul, claiming conspiracy. its only claim against paul is that paul conspired with yoko ono, john lennon, george harrison and ringo starr as well as bag production and other corporations wantonly, maliciously, fraudulently, wrongfully and intentionally without justification in law or fact to damage or injure plaintiff (abkco).' damages are sought for this alleged conspiracy of $ million plus interest."" our interviews were delayed some months, first by a wings tour and later by a series of recording sessions in nigeria. even after that wait, the mccartneys seemed surprised at how much we wanted to know. in the end they were interviewed in a london recording studio, paul's soho office, lee eastman's offices and apartment in new york (where baby stella mccartney wore the interviewer's watch on her foot) and the studio of cover photographer francesco scavullo. as the interview begins, paul is telling how he wrote one of the songs he recorded in nigeria. – p.g. we were in jamaica on holiday and we were staying in a little house outside montego bay, and we read in the local newspaper, the daily gleaner, that dustin hoffman and steve mcqueen were in town filming papillon. they were just along the coast from us. we were saying it would be great to meet him, have dinner with him, so linda rang up. she's good at that, i'm always a bit embarrassed. we got friendly and were chatting away. we'd been talking about songwriting, and dustin was saying he thought it was an incredible gift to be able to write a song about something. people think that, but i always maintain it's the same as any gift. it probably is more magical because it's music, and i think it is more magical. but take his acting talent. it's great. i was saying, ""it's the same as you and acting, when the man says 'action!' you just pull it out of the bag, don't you? you don't know where it comes from, you just do it! how do you get all of your characterizations? it's just in you. so he says, ""you mean you can just do it, like that?"" he was lovely, dustin.  ""you can just do it?"" we went back a couple of days later and he said, ""i've been thinking about this, i've seen a little thing in time magazine about picasso, and it struck me as being very poetic. i think this would be really great set to music."" it was one of those passed on bits, you know, transition or whatever they call it. ...  ... transvestite. ... so he says there's a little story here. in the article he supposedly said, ""drink to me, drink to my health, you know i can't drink any more."" he went to paint a bit, and then he went to bed at three in the morning. he didn't wake up the next morning and they found him, dead. i happened to have my guitar with me, i'd brought it around, and i said, yeah, sure. i strummed a couple of chords i knew i couldn't go wrong on and started singing ""drink to me, drink to my health,"" and he leaps out of his chair and says, ""annie! annie!"" that's his wife. he says, ""annie! annie! the most incredible thing! he's doing it! he's writing it! it's coming out!"" he's leaping up and down, just like in the films, you know. and i'm knocked out because he's so appreciative. i was writing the tune there and he was well-chuffed. then we went to nigeria and we were working in ginger's studio – ginger baker/arc studio in lagos, nice studio down there. we thought we'd do this picasso number, and we started off doing it straight. then we thought, picasso was kind of far out in his pictures, he'd done all these different kinds of things, fragmented, cubism and the whole bit. i thought it would be nice to get a track a bit like that, put it through different moods, cut it up, edit it, mess around with it – like he used to do with his pictures. you see the old films of him painting, he paints it once and if he doesn't like it he paints it again, right on top of it, and by about  times he's got his picture. so we tried to use this kind of idea, i don't know much about it to tell you the truth, but what we did know we tried to get in the song, sort of a cubist thing. then there was the trouble in nigeria with fela ransome kuti . you heard about that? all it was was we were recording in lagos. lately we've gone to two different places to record, just for the fun of it. we've been to lagos and to paris and in both of the places they say, ""why did you come here? you've got much better studios in england or america, you must be daft!"" and we say, ""well, it's just for the fun, it's just to come somewhere different for a different type of turn-on, that's all."" they never really seem to be able to understand it. i think old fela, when he found us in lagos, thought, ""hello, why have they come to lagos?"" and the only reason he could think of was that we must be stealing black music, black african music, the lagos sound, we'd come down there to pick it up. so i said, ""do us a favor, we do ok as it is, we're not pinching your music."" they felt that they have their own little ethnic thing going and these big foreigners are taking all their bit and beating them back to the west with it. because they have a lot of difficulty getting their sound heard in the west. there's not an awful lot of demand, except for things like, what was it, ""soul makossa."" except for that kind of thing they don't really get heard. and they are brilliant, it's incredible music down there. i think it will come to the fore. and i thought my visit would, if anything, help them, because it would draw attention to lagos and people would say, ""oh, by the way, what's the music down there like?"" and i'd say it was unbelievable. it is unbelievable. when i heard fela ransome kuti the first time, it made me cry, it was that good. you've just had some musicians leave, haven't you? our drummer  didn't want to come to africa. i don't know quite why. he was a bit nervous about coming to africa. we're all going to africa to record and if the drummer won't come, what do you do? you don't say, ""well, we'll see you when we get back, thanks a lot we understand."" you say, ""well, er, ummm,"" and he leaves. i think  henry mcculloch came to a head one day when i was asking him to play something he didn't really fancy playing. we all got a bit choked about it, and he rang up later and said he was leaving. i said, ""well, ok."" that's how that happened. you know, with the kind of music we play, a guitarist has got to be a bit adaptable. it was just one of those things. i don't think there was anything wrong with them as musicians, they were both good musicians, but they just didn't fit in. in the film 'a hard day's night,' there were the stereotypes – if you remember john the thinker, ringo the loner, and paul the happy-go-lucky. did you object to that? no, i didn't mind it. no, no; i still don't. i was in a film. i don't care what they picture me as. so far as i'm concerned i'm just doing a job in a film. if the film calls for me to be a cheerful chap, well, great; i'll be a cheerful chap. it does seem to have fallen in my role to be kind of a bit more that than others. i was always known in the beatle thing as being the one who would kind of sit the press down and say, ""hello, how are you? do you want a drink?"" and make them comfortable. i guess that's me. my family loop was like that. so i kind of used to do that, plus a little more polished than i might normally have done, but you're aware you're talking to the press. ... you want a good article, don't you, so you don't want to go sluggin' the guys off. but i'm not ashamed of anything i've been, you know. i kind of like the idea of doing something and if it turns out in a few years to look a bit sloppy i'd say, ""oh well, sloppy. so what?"" i think most people dig it. you get people livin' out in queens or say red creek, minnesota, and they're all wiped out themselves ... you know, ordinary people. once you get into the kind of critical bit, people analyzing you and then you start to look at yourself and start to analyze yourself, and you think, oh christ, you got me, and things start to rebound on ya, why didn't i put on a kind of smart image ... you know, why wasn't i kind of tougher? i'm not really tough. i'm not really lovable, either, but i don't mind falling in the middle. my dad's advice: moderation, son. every father in the world tells you moderation.  british parents aren't different ... no, they're exactly the same. my dad could be the perfect american stereotype father. he's a good lad, though; i like him, you know. i tell you what. i think that a lot of people worried about that kind of stuff didn't often have very good family scenes, and something happened in their family to make them bitter. ok, in the normal day-to-day life a lot of polished talk goes on ... you don't love everyone you meet, but you try and get on with people, you know, you don't try and put 'em up-tight; most people don't anyway. so to me that's always been the way. i mean, there's nothin' wrong with that; why should i go around slugging people? i really didn't like all that john did. but i'm sure that he doesn't now. have you talked to him about that? no, but i know john and i know that most of it was just something to tell the newspapers. he was in that mood then and he wanted all that to be said. i think, now, whilst he probably doesn't regret it, he didn't mean every single syllable of it. i mean, he came out with all stuff like i'm like engelbert humperdinck. i know he doesn't really think that. in the press, they really wanted me to come out and slam john back and i used to get pissed at the guys coming up to me and saying, ""this is the latest thing john said and what's your answer."" and i'd say, ""well, don't really have much of an answer. he's got a right to say ..."" – you know, really limp things, i'd answer. but i believe keep cool and that sort of thing and it passes over. i don't believe if someone kind of punches you over you have to go kind of thumping him back to prove you're a man and that kind of thing. i think, actually, you do win that way in the end, you know. what was your reaction when you read that stuff at the time? oh, i hated it. you can imagine, i sat down and pored over every little paragraph, every little sentence. ""does he really think that of me?"" i thought. and at the time, i thought, ""it's me. i am. that's just what i'm like. he's captured me so well; i'm a turd, you know."" i sat down and really thought, i'm just nothin'. but then, well, kind of people who dug me like linda said, ""now you know that's not true, you're joking. he's got a grudge, man; the guy's trying to polish you off."" gradually i started to think, great, that's not true. i'm not really like engelbert; i don't just write ballads. and that kept me kind of hanging on; but at the time, i tell you, it hurt me. whew. deep. could you write a song or songs with john again? i could. it's totally fresh ground, right now, 'cause i just got my visa, too. about two or three days ago; and until then, i couldn't physically write a song with john; he was in america. he couldn't get out. i couldn't get in. but now that's changed so whole new possibilities are opening up. anything could happen. i like to write with john. i like to write with anyone who's good. right now you yourself are working on the mouse gang. no, it's not the mouse gang, it's a show that will be called the bruce mcmouse show. i was thinking of the zoo gang. the zoo gang, that's right, that's just a theme tune for a television show i was asked to do. bruce mcmouse is another thing. we filmed the last couple of dates at the end of wings' first european tour. bruce lives under the stage, you see.  are you constantly deluged with this type of offer? not deluged. i get quite a few, you know. i just try and choose the ones i like the sound of. it's not anything i plan out. i remember a thing in rolling stone – there's a little bit of chat, i read the papers, you know – that said ""mccartney's going to do live and let die, so it's come to that, has it?"" i thought, you silly sods. because we were talking to another paper and when i said i was going to do live and let die, the  thing, the reporter said, ""hey, man, that's real hip."" so it just depends which way you look at it. ""give ireland back to the irish"" was the first of your singles in eight years that didn't sell in america and britain. before i did that, i always used to think, god, john's crackers, doing all these political songs. i understand he really feels deeply, you know. so do i. i hate all that nixon bit, all that ireland bit, and oppression anywhere. i think our mob do, our generation do hate that and wish it could be changed, but up until the actual time when the paratroopers went in and killed a few people, a bit like kent state, the moment when it is actually there on the doorstep, i always used to think it's still cool to not say anything about it, because it's not going to sell anyway and no one's gonna be interested. so i tried it, it was number one in ireland and, funnily enough, it was number one in spain, of all places. i don't think franco could have understood.  did you feel scared when mccartney was released, since that was your debut and the first song was pegged at you? no. i didn't take it as seriously as i probably should have. i think it was good copy at the time to slag everything. everybody was getting slagged, the beatles were getting slagged. i personally didn't realize you had to explain yourself a lot once you get into the public eye. i just carried on with my normal life, like i had in new york, and i just got all this slagging. it never really brought me down much, though. do you think any mrs. mccartney in that situation would have been slagged? i think in what was going down then, yes. there was so much trouble for everybody, not done by one particular person, that everybody was getting blamed. i still can't look at it from the angle that i'm mrs. mccartney. you know what i mean? i still see me as the person i've always been, either you like me or you don't. paul likes me.  and stood up for you during the slagging. he was living with me, he knows i'm a good chick, he knows i don't have any bad motives. i'm not a grabber, i'm not any of that. he wouldn't have married me if i had been. so he stuck by me. i just read totally bizarre stuff about myself. people would do an article on me and then an article on yoko from childhood on up. i couldn't believe it. it was total fantasy. i mean, none of that happened, folks. unlike john, who went to a solo career, paul went to a group. john didn't really go to a solo career, there was the plastic ono band and that. but paul is very much a teamwork person. he doesn't like working just on his own. he still gets nervous. he likes working with people, bouncing off people and having them bounce off him. he likes helping people. have you ever entertained the thought of doing a record by yourself? not linda mccartney's great single, no. i fool around with the songs i write, but i don't take it as a serious career. you do have the novelty single coming up? yes. i did a song, ""seaside woman,"" right after we'd been to jamaica, about three or four years ago, i guess. very reggae-inspired. that's when atv was suing us saying i was incapable of writing, so paul said, ""get out and write a song."" and then about a week ago we went in to do a b side for it of something i'd written in africa, some chords i wrote in africa, and we just talk over it. it's very sort of fifties r&b, the doves, the penguins. i love that, that was my era. i'm new york, you know, alan freed and the whole bit. we're going to put the single out under the name suzi and the red stripes. when we were in jamaica, there had been a fantastic reggae version of ""suzi q,"" so they used to call me suzi. and the beer in jamaica is called red stripe, so that makes it suzi and the red stripes. it'll be out someday, but i've been saying ""seaside woman"" will be released since  and we still haven't bothered. it's a bit like my photography book. someday there will be a book. was it strictly through you that your father became associated with paul as his lawyer? it's through me, actually. i remember saying to my father, when i'd met paul a few times but wasn't living with him, after brian died, that he had helped a lot of people out of messes, could he help? he said well, i don't know. i said it would be great because i know you could help them out. so then i introduced paul to my dad, and they got along instantly. if he hadn't met my father, klein would have just hawked right in there.  how did you meet linda? linda and i met in a club in london called the bag of nails, which was right about the time that the club scene was going strong in london. she was down there with some friends. i think she was down there with chas chandler and some other people, and i was down there with some friends, including a guy who used to work at the office. i was in my little booth and she was in her little booth and we were giving each other the eye you know. georgie fame was playing that night and we were both right into georgie fame. when did you first realize you wanted to marry her? about a year later. we both thought it a bit crazy at the time, and we also thought it would be a gas. linda was a bit dubious, because she had been married before and wasn't too set on settling. in a way, she thought it tends to blow things, marrying ruins it. but we both fancied each other enough to do it. and now we're glad we did it, you know. it's great. i love it. some of the critical notices on her debut performances seemed to ask where she had come from. yeah. well, the answer is, nowhere, really. mick jagger had that quote. he wouldn't let... ... his old lady in the band, yeah. that was all very understandable at the time because she did kind of appear out of nowhere. to most people, she was just some chick. i just figure she was the main help for me on the albums around that time. she was there every day, helping on harmonies and all of that stuff. it's like you write millions of love songs and finally when you're in love you'd kind of like to write one for the person you're in love with. so i think all this business about getting linda in the billing was just a way of saying, ""listen, i don't care what you think, this is what i think. i'm putting her right up there with me."" later we thought it might have been cooler not to introduce her so bluntly. perhaps a little more show business: ""ladies and gentlemen, i'd like to introduce you to my better half. isn't she sweet and coy?"" it turns out it didn't matter, it didn't matter one bit. at the time it was a little rough, maybe. at the time it was rough for her. none of us realized what ... it was like someone marrying mick, you don't realize ... you know there's going to be a lot of fans who are going to hate it, but you still end up thinking, well, it's my life. i know of a lot of rock & roll stars or just even show business people who will regulate their life to their image. it can mess you up a lot. i know a lot of guys from the old days who wouldn't get married, even if they wanted to. wouldn't get married because it might affect their careers. the old management thing – ""you can't get married, all your fans are going to desert you."" so the guy doesn't get married. but the thing is, in a couple of years, his career is over anyway. and he didn't get married, and he went and blew it. so i didn't. ""well, i'm not going to let that kind of thing interfere with me."" although i didn't wish to blow my career, i thought it was more important to get on with living. we went ahead and just did what we felt like doing. some of it came out possibly a bit offensive to some people, but it turns out that it didn't matter in the first place. you just keep going. did your friends in music stick by you at that time or did you find it a little tough? or did you have that many friends at the time? i remember ringo saying at the time ""how many friends have i got?"" and he couldn't count them on one hand. and that's what it boils down to, really. you can have millions of friends, but when someone asks you how many friends you've got, it depends on how honestly you're going to answer. because i don't think i have that many. no one went against me or anything, i think i isolated myself a bit. it's just one of those things. we had just met for the first time. we're very romantic, the both of us, and we didn't really want to hang out with anyone else. do you often go back to liverpool? we visit to keep in touch with the liverpool scene. my family roots are up there, our kids love, it, and my brother still lives there. in fact, we're going to make an album with him in january. will it come out as a mike mcgear album? that's right. it's a singing thing, he's quit comedy for the moment. we're going to do it at strawberry studios in stockport. we'll play it by ear, it's mike's album. is it difficult for the kids, being your daughters? i don't think so, i don't think they're going to be crazed-out kids. but it is funny sometimes. i remember i was sitting in a field and heather was leading mary and a little baby on a pony, and mary just said to me, ""you're paul mccartney, aren't you?"" when she's talking to me normally, she'll just call me daddy. when there's company around, she knows i'm paul mccartney, in inverted commas. it's nice that we have all girls. if we had a son it might be harder on him, like frank sinatra, jr. everyone assumes he'll turn out to be his dad. at the moment, there's not much to worry about with the kids. at your oxford press conference you mentioned your four-year-old daughter liked the osmonds. linda says your ten-year-old daughter is a bit off them now ... yes, she is a bit... ...but i understand you met the osmonds in paris, which is a very unusual situation. it must have been as much of a thrill for them to meet you as it would be for a four-year-old to meet them. a layer cake of generations. as we're talking today three of the top six here  are by them, which is the greatest chart domination by a group since . they're very liked here by a lot of the record buyers, which in britain are the young kids. from your personal experience, do you think they can understand how much they mean to people? sure they know, sure. i think little jimmy probably knows less than the others what's going on, but they seem to. they've got that kind of american showbiz family feeling, which does work. you can put it down, but it really does work. they've been doing it for years on the andy williams show, and they're troupers already. you know, the kid's only eight or something, little jimmy, but he's already a little trouper. he has what a seasoned performer has. when you were in their position, did you feel a sense of responsibility, or did you feel the world had gone crazy? no, no. we were a band who'd been trying to make it big for a long time. when you're trying to get to the top, when you start to get there, that's probably the biggest thrill. you don't think the whole world's gone crazy; you think it's great that they like you and you're well-chuffed that you're going down so well. that's all that enters your head. i think that even little jimmy just thinks, ""hey, man, that's great, that's far-out."" you know? he just loves it. and that's really the best way. when you get thinking too heavily about all of this stuff, like anything, you can do so many doublethinks on it all you end up with is not liking it, which is the only hang up. when you end up not liking it then you start to do it less well. i always thought, just great, great band, great things, kids screaming, fantastic, fabulous, great, everyone's having a good night out. that sort of thing, basically. were you frightened of possible negative reaction when you released your solo album, mccartney? it was your first break from the beatles. i was as confident as i ever am about any lp. i realize it was more kind of throwaway and done at home than any of the previous ones, but that wasn't a reason to worry about it. you never know what people are going to think about a record anyway. the handout on the british edition of mccartney didn't appear in america. why was that? linda and i did a mail-out from our house. we had made up this little interview for friends and the press and sent them out with about the first hundred albums. somebody thought it was supposed to be a thing that came with the album, probably because we didn't explain it in the mailing. we should have said. ""enclosed find press kit."" people got the idea it came with the album, but it didn't come out in britain in the copies in the stores. i had asked peter brown  for a list of questions he thought might have interesting answers. looking back, it seems a bit blunt and weird, but at the time it wasn't meant to be. things like, ""are you gonna be another john and yoko?"" ""no, we're gonna be a paul and linda."" little silly things like that. how did you feel people would react to linda's presence? she was on let it be doing backup vocals. that was her first appearance, and nobody said much about that. the time we did mccartney, as it was largely recorded in the back room, she was always there. that was how she came to be on the album as much as she was. you did have the release date close to let it be. there was some hassle at the time. we were arguing over who had mentioned a release date first. it was all a bit petty. i'd pegged a release date and then let it be was scheduled near it. i saw it as victimization, but now i'm sure it wasn't. seeing that let it be was released basically after the fact, do you wish it had not been released? oh, no. i don't wish that about anything. everything seems to take its place in history after it's happened and it's fine to let it stay there. it was the first album to have the little bits on, like the type that also appeared on mccartney. i rather fancied having just the plain tapes and nothing done to them at all. we had thought of doing something looser before, but the albums always turned out to be well-produced. that was the idea of the whole album. all the normal things that you record that are great and have all this atmosphere but aren't brilliant recordings or production jobs normally are left out and wind up on, say, pete townshend's cutting floor. it ends up with the rest of his demos. but all that stuff is often stuff i love. it's got the door opening, the banging of the tape recorder, a couple of people giggling in the background. when you've got friends around, those are the kind of tracks you play them. you don't play them the big finished produced version. like ""hey jude,"" i think i've got that tape somewhere, where i'm going on and on with all these funny words. i remember i played it to john and yoko and i was saying, ""these words won't be on the finished version."" some of the words were ""the movement you need is on your shoulder,"" and john was saying, ""it's great! 'the movement you need is on your shoulder.' "" i'm saying, ""it's crazy, it doesn't make any sense at all."" he's saying, ""sure it does, it's great."" i'm always saying that, by the way, that's me, i'm always never sure if it's good enough. that's me, you know. so when mccartney came along i had all these rough things and i liked them all and thought, well, they're rough, but they've got that certain kind of thing about them, so we'll leave it and just put it out. it's not an album which was really sweated over, and yet now i find it's a lot of people's favorite. they think it's great to hear the kids screaming and the door opening, it's lovely. the first of your albums with some of those little bitsy things was 'let it be.' had you wanted to do that before? yes, i think so. in the back of everyone's mind there was always that kind of thing. the sound of a tape being spooled back is an interesting sound. if you're working in a recording studio, you hear it all the time and get used to it. you don't think anything of it. but when the man switches on the tape machine in the middle of a track and you hear that kind of djeeoww, and then – the track starts, i'd always liked all that, all those rough edges and loose ends. it gives it a kind of live excitement. when you do have rough edges on an album, you're open to interpretation. there's the famous example of john and yoko's 'wedding album,' where the reviewer reviewed the tone on the test pressing and said that the subtle fluctuations in this tone were very arty. the whole analysis business is a funny business, it's almost like creating history before it's been created. when a thing happens you immediately start analyzing it as if it was  years ago, as if it was king henry viii who said it. it is daft, actually, but you can't blame anyone for doing it, they've got to write something. unless they can say ""i was around at his house and he gave me a nice cup of tea ... funny little blue cups he gave it in ..."" they've got to say, well, what did you mean by this, or what was that tone. with one song you mentioned just a few minutes ago, ""hey jude,"" everyone was trying to figure out who jude was. i happened to be driving out to see cynthia lennon. i think it was just after john and she had broken up, and i was quite mates with julian . he's a nice kid, julian. and i was going out in me car just vaguely singing this song, and it was like ""hey jules."" i don't know why, ""hey jules."" it was just this thing, you know, ""don't make it bad/ take a sad song ..."" and then i just thought a better name was jude. a bit more country & western for me. once you get analyzing something and looking into it, things do begin to appear and things do begin to tie in. because everything ties in, and what you get depends on your approach to it. you look at everything with a black attitude and it's all black. this other idea of paul is dead. that was on for a while. i had just turned up at a photo session and it was at the time when linda and i were just beginning to knock around with each other steadily. it was a hot day in london, a really nice hot day, and i think i wore sandals. i only had to walk around the corner to the crossing because i lived pretty nearby. i had me sandals on and for the photo session i thought i'll take my sandals off. linda: no, you were barefoot. paul: oh, i was barefoot. yeah, that's it. you know, so what? barefoot, nice warm day, i didn't feel like wearing shoes. so i went around to the photo session and showed me bare feet. of course when that comes out and people start looking at it they say, ""why has he got no shoes on? he's never done that before."" ok, you've never seen me do it before, but, in actual fact, it's just me with my shoes off. turns out to be some old mafia sign of death or something. then the this-little-bit-if-you-play-it-backwards stuff. as i say, nine times out of ten it's really nothing. take the end of sgt. pepper, that backward thing, ""we'll fuck you like supermen."" some fans came around to my door giggling. i said, ""hello, what do you want?"" they said, ""is it true, that bit at the end? is it true? it says 'we'll fuck you like supermen.'"" i said, ""no, you're kidding. i haven't heard it, but i'll play it."" it was just some piece of conversation that was recorded and turned backwards. but i went inside after i'd seen them and played it studiously, turned it backwards with my thumb against the motor, turned the motor off and did it backwards. and there it was, sure as anything, plain as anything. ""we'll fuck you like supermen."" i thought, jesus, what can you do? and then there was ""i buried paul."" that wasn't ""i buried paul"" at all, that was john saying ""cranberry sauce."" it was the end of ""strawberry fields."" that's john's humor. john would say something totally out of synch, like ""cranberry sauce."" if you don't realize that john's apt to say ""cranberry sauce"" when he feels like it, then you start to hear a funny little word there, and you think ""aha!"" when you were alive and presumed dead, what did you think? someone from the office rang me up and said, ""look, paul, you're dead."" and i said, ""oh, i don't agree with that."" and they said, ""look, what are you going to do about it? it's a big thing breaking in america. you're dead."" and so i said leave it, just let them say it. it'll probably be the best publicity we've ever had and i won't have to do a thing except stay alive. so i managed to stay alive through it. a couple of people came up and said, ""can i photograph you to prove you're not dead?"" coincidentally, around about that time, i was playing down a lot of the old beatle image and getting a bit more to what i felt was me, letting me beard grow and not being so hung up on keeping fresh and clean. i looked different, more laid back, and so i had people coming up saying ""you're not him!"" and i was beginning to think, ""i am, you know, but i know what you mean. i don't look like him, but believe me."" you were supposedly billy shears, according to one of the theories. ringo's billy shears. definitely. that was just in the production of sgt. pepper. it just happened to turn out that we dreamed up billy shears. it was a rhyme for ""years"" ... ""band you've known for all these years ... and here he is, the one and only billy shears."" we thought, that's a great little name, it's an eleanor-rigby-type name, a nice atmospheric name, and it was leading into ringo's track. so as far as we were concerned it was purely and simply a device to get the next song in. your two big television shows were the james paul mccartney and the magical mystery tour shows. how were these conceived? the mystery show was conceived way back in los angeles. on the plane. you know they give you those big menus and i had a pen and everything and started drawing on this menu and i had this idea. in england they have these things called mystery tours. and you go on them and you pay so much and you don't know where you're going. so the idea was to have this little thing advertised in the shop windows somewhere called magical mystery tours. someone goes in and buys a ticket and rather than just being the kind of normal publicity hype of magical ... well, it never is magical, really ... the idea of the show was that it was actually a magical run – a real magical trip. i did a few little sketches myself and everyone else thought up a couple of little things. john thought of a little thing and george thought of a scene and we just kind of built it up. then we hired a coach and picked actors out of an actor's directory and we just got them all along with the coach and we said, ""ok, act."" an off-the-cuff kind of thing. the james paul mccartney show were these people who wanted us to do a tv show and they said they wanted a nice show and said you can do it any way you want. this seemed like a good opportunity, you know, to kinda get on the telly. so that one was just worked up that way. we met the guy when we went to morocco. we were on holiday then and they came out and we sat around the pool and talked about various ideas and came back to england and did it. were you sorry the magical mystery tour was not shown in america? at the time, hey, i thought, ""oh, blimey,"" but ... eh ... it started out to be one of those kind of things. like the wild one, you know, marlon brando ... at the time it couldn't be released. the interest in it came later. the interest started to grow, you know. magical mystery show was a bit like that ... well, whatever happened to it ... that's a bit magical itself. like the stones' rock and roll circus. you know, what happened to that, you know. i mean, i'd like to see that. so all of those things work out well. you've got to be patient. everything like that works out well. i think it was a good show. it will have its day, you know. there was an interesting reaction to james paul mccartney. some people liked some parts and didn't like others. i can understand that. you know, i think a lot of people thought we could have done more ... could have done a better show. it was a little bitty . that was a fair comment, but i got a lot of letters from people, you know, just people, old people, from like red creek, minnesota, just saying, ""hey man, dug the show, you know."" you told me you still ask your friends, ""is this really good?"" and linda mentioned that you still get nervous about the work. and so does this mean you watch critical notices very closely? no, i don't like criticism whatever. i don't think i ever liked it when my dad said, i don't like your trousers. but i went through a difficult period where i started to listen to what the newspapers have to say ... about me ... and say, some guy would be sittin' in new york all hung up thinking, ""well, that's not as good as i woulda wanted."" and i thought, ""well, blimey, that's only one guy. i'm not going to take it as gospel."" linda mentioned you ""bounce off"" people. after you left george martin and the other three, was linda the only person to bounce your ideas off of? for a while, yes. oh yes. did you miss not having more people? is there anyone you ask now outside of people in the band? sometimes now i mainly bounce off myself. i do that more now, call it what you will – maturity? sometimes if a friend is in the studio i'll ask for their opinion and that will make it easier on me. the laugh of all this is i say all this rubbish and it all changes the next day. i still read the notices and stuff and they're usually bum ones when you're expecting them to be great. like after ram, there were a lot of bum notices after ram. but i keep meetin' people wherever i go, like i met someone skiing. as he skiied past me he said, ""i loved ram, paul."" so that's really what i go by. just the kind of people who flash by me in life. just ordinary people and they said they loved it. that's why i go a lot by sales, not just for the commercial thing. like if a thing sells well, it means a lot of people bought it and liked it. does that mean, then, that you didn't think too much in retrospect of 'wild life'? because of all your albums ... no, ah, i quite liked it. i must say you have to like me to like the record. i mean, if it's just taken cold, i think it wasn't that brilliant as a recording. we did it in about two weeks, the whole thing. and it had been done on that kind of a buzz we'd been hearing about how dylan had come in and done everything in one take. i think in fact often we never gave the engineer a chance to even set up a balance. there's a couple of real big songs on there, that only freaks or connoisseurs know. well, ""tomorrow."" yeah, ""tomorrow"" is one of them. it's like, when i'm talking to people about picasso or something and they say, well, his blue period was his only one that was any good. but for me, if the guy does some great things then even his downer moments are interesting. his lesser moments, rather, because they make up the final picture. some moments seem less, he was going through kind of a pressure period. you know, you can't live your life without pressure periods. no one i know has. you mentioned dylan sort of being an inspiration for doing 'wild life' the way you did it ... he's going on the road, of course, this month. with the band ... does this in any way motivate you, inspire you? no, not particularly. i mean, i've just been on the road last year, so my being ... doing that just might have inspired him; i don't know, you know. he's a great guy, dylan; he's a musician, and stuff, and he's a great spirit. love him, you know. do you think he influenced you at all? oh, yes. very heavily. i think the first time was in ""you've got to hide your love away."" that was john's song. then there was a good deal of influence in the hard day's night and help! periods. certain chords, the acoustic bit. we liked him. we met him when we came to new york and we were together awhile. he came to one of my sessions when i was doing ram in new york. you mentioned in the studio that you were influenced in a recent session by marvin gaye's ""trouble man."" do you think fela or someone else might misconstrue this? being influenced by something and stealing something are two different things. when you hear the track we did and hear marvin gaye's you probably would never know they were related. i may be influenced by something, but it's in my head and doesn't necessarily show in the song. ""here, there and everywhere"" was supposed to be a beach boys song, but you wouldn't have known. ""hi hi hi"" was the one that brought you back to the top ten, after ""give ireland back to the irish"" and ""mary had a little lamb,"" although in britain they played ""c moon"" because ""hi hi hi"" was banned by the bbc. i thought the ""hi hi hi"" thing could easily be taken as a natural high, could be taken as booze high and everything. it doesn't have to be drugs, you know, so i'd kind of get away with it. well, the first thing they saw was drugs, so i didn't get away with that, and then i just had some line ""lie on the bed and get ready for my polygon."" the daft thing about all of that was our publishing company, northern songs, owned by lew grade, got the lyrics wrong and sent them round to the radio station and it said, ""get ready for my body gun,"" which is far more suggestive than anything i put. ""get ready for my polygon,"" watch out baby, i mean it was suggestive, but abstract suggestive, which i thought i'd get away with. bloody company goes round and makes it much more specific by putting ""body gun."" better words, almost. it made it anyway in the states. yeah, well, the great laugh is when we go live, it makes a great announcement. you can say ""this one was banned!"" and everyone goes ""hooray!"" the audience love it, you know. ""this next one was banned,"" and then you get raving, because everyone likes to. everyone's a bit anti-all-that-banning, all that censorship. our crew, our generation, really doesn't dig that stuff, as i'm sure you know. ""helen wheels"" has done better in america than england, as have many of your records past, back to the old days. have you ever thought of a reason why? the only thing i can think of is the foreigner syndrome. we're british, and that means something to an american. it's like some americans who do better over here, like cassidy and the osmonds, even elvis. it's been suggested that the beatles provided something for americans they had lost with the death of kennedy – youth, happiness, freedom from inhibitions. does that make much sense to you? no, none at all. in songwriting technique, how did you compose with john? how did you compose yourself and then with linda? well, first, i started off on my own. very early on i met john, and we then, gradually, started to write stuff together. which didn't mean we wrote everything together. we'd kind of write % together and the other % for me were things like ""yesterday"" and for john things like ""strawberry fields"" that he'd mainly write on his own. and i did certain stuff on my own. so i've done stuff on my own. when i said how do you compose, i meant actually sitting down and doing it. did you use guitar, or did you use piano? when i first started writing songs i started using a guitar. the first one i ever wrote was one called ""my little girl"" which is a funny little song, a nice little song, a corny little song based on three chords – g,  and c. a little later we had a piano and i used to bang around on that. i wrote ""when i'm sixty-four"" when i was about . i wrote the tune for that and i was vaguely thinking then it might come in handy in a musical comedy or something. i didn't know what kind of career i was going to take. so i wrote that on piano and from there it's really been a mixture of the both. i just do either, now. sometimes i've got a guitar in my hands; sometimes i'm sittin' at a piano. it depends whatever instrument i'm at – i'll compose on it, you know. do you start with a title or a line, or what? oh, different ways. every time it's different. ""all my loving"" – an old beatle song, remember that one, folks? – i wrote that one like a bit of poetry, and then i put a song to it later. something like ""yesterday,"" i did the tune first and wrote words to that later. i called that ""scrambled egg"" for a long time. i didn't have any words to it.  so then i got words to that; so i say, every time is different, really. i like to keep it that way, too; i don't get any set formula. so that each time, i'm pullin' it out of the air. when did you get the idea you were going to bring in a string quartet on ""scrambled egg""? first of all, i was just playing it through for everyone – saying, how do you like this song? i played it just me on acoustic, and sang it. and the rest of the beatles said, ""that's it. love it."" so george martin and i got together and sort of cooked up this idea. i wanted just a small string arrangement. and he said, ""well, how about your actual string quartet?"" i said great, it sounds great. we sat down at a piano and cooked that one up. how would you see george martin's contributions in those songs in those days? george's contribution was quite a big one, actually. the first time he really ever showed that he could see beyond what we were offering him was ""please please me."" it was originally conceived as a roy orbison-type thing, you know. george martin said, ""well, we'll put the tempo up."" he lifted the tempo and we all thought that was much better and that was a big hit. george was in there quite heavily from the beginning. the time we got offended, i'll tell you, was one of the reviews, i think about sgt. pepper – one of the reviews said, ""this is george martin's finest album."" we got shook; i mean, ""we don't mind him helping us, it's great, it's a great help, but it's not his album, folks, you know."" and there got to be a little bitterness over that. a bit help, but christ, if he's goin' to get all the credit ... for the whole album ...  the wings tour in  was the first time you had toured in six years, wasn't it? yes. had you intended to keep it that long? oh, no, no, no. with the beatles we did a big american tour, and. i think the feeling, mainly from george and john, was, ""oh, this is getting a little bit uhhh ..."" but i thought, ""no, you can't give up live playing, we'd be crazy to."" but then we did a concert tour i really hated and i came off stormy and saying, ""bloody hell, i really agree with you now."" where was that? in america, somewhere, i can't remember exactly. it was raining and we were playing under some sort of big canopy and everybody felt they were going to get electric shocks and stuff. we were driven off in a big truck afterwards and i remember sitting in the back of the truck saying, bloody hell, they're right, this is stupid. so we knew we were going to give up playing but we didn't want to go make some big announcement, that we were giving it all up or anything, so we just kind of cooled it and didn't go out. when anyone asked we'd say, ""oh, we'll be going out again,"" but we really didn't think we would. so we recorded a lot and stuff and nobody felt the need to go out and play. after six years i just thought it would be good to get out, because live shows are a lot of what it's about. if nothing else, you get out there and see what people want. i remember at the end of the beatles thinking that it would be good if i just went out with some country & western group. to have a sing every day surely must improve my voice a bit. when you did start to play live again, were you very nervous? yes. very nervous. the main thing i didn't want to face was the torment of five rows of press people with little pads all looking and saying, ""oh, well, he's not as good as he was."" so we decided to go out on that university tour, which made me less nervous because it was less of a big deal. we went out on that tour and by the end of that i felt quite ready for something else, and we went to europe. i was pretty scared on the europe tour. that was a bit more of a big deal, here he is, ladies and gentlemen, sold all the tickets out ... i had to go on with a band i really didn't know much. we decided not to do any beatle material, which was a killer, of course, because it meant we had to do an hour of other material, and we didn't have it, then. i didn't have something like ""my love"" that was sort of mine. i felt like everyone wanted beatles stuff, so i was pretty nervous on that. but by the end of the europe tour i felt better, and at the end of the british tour i felt good. by the time we did the british tour i knew we could get it easily and that i could get it going. everyone digs it, and there's enough stuff not to be nervous. on the wings tour the one song you did from the past was ""long tall sally."" the first time i ever sang on a stage i did ""long tall sally."" i must have been pretty young, probably ; i feel like i might have been , i don't know. we went to stay with our parents at a holiday camp called butlins, a branch in wales. they used to have these talent shows, and one of my cousins-in-law was one of the red coats who had something to do with the entertainment. he called us up on the stage, i had my guitar with me. looking back on it, it must have been a put-up job, i don't know what i was doing there with my guitar. i probably asked him to get me up or something. i went up with my brother mike, who had just recovered from breaking his arm and looked all pale. he had his arm in a big sling. we used to do an everly brothers number, something like ""bye bye love."" i think it might have been ""bye bye love,"" in fact. we did that, and then i finished with ""long tall sally."" ever since i heard little richard's version, i started imitating him. it was just straight imitation, really, which has gradually become my version of it as much as richard's. i started doing it in one of the classrooms at school, it was just one of the imitations i could do well. i could do fats domino, i could do elvis, i could do a few people.  i still can! ""i'm walking, yes indeed, i'm ...""  ""thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.""  that's elvis. did many of those black artists appeal to you in the late fifties and early sixties? john did several motown songs. yes, very much. i loved all that stuff. those were my favorites, definitely. when did you first think you wanted to be in a band? i didn't think i wanted to be in one; i wanted to do something in music and my dad gave me a trumpet, for my birthday. i went through trying to learn that. but my mouth used to get too sore. you know, you have to go through a period of gettin' your lip hard. i suddenly realized i wouldn't be able to sing if i played trumpet. so i figured guitar would be better. it was about the time that guitar was beginning to be the instrument. so i went and swapped my trumpet for a guitar and i got that home and couldn't figure out what was wrong and i suddenly decided to turn the strings around and that made a difference and i realized i was left-handed. i started from there, really; that was my first kind of thing, and then once you had a guitar you were then kind of eligible for bands and stuff. but i never thought of myself being in a band. one day i went with this friend of mine. his name was ivan . and i went up to woolton, in liverpool, and there was a village fete on, and john and his friends were playing for the thing. my friend ivan knew john, who was a neighbor of his. and we met there and john was onstage singing ""come little darlin', come and go with me..."" the del vikings' ""come go with me""? but he never knew the words because he didn't know the record, so he made up his own words, like ""down, down, down, down, to the penitentiary."" i remember i was impressed. i thought, wow, he's good. that's a good band there. so backstage, back in the church hall later, i was singing a couple of songs i'd known. i used to know all the words to ""twenty flight rock"" and a few others and it was pretty much in those days to know the words to that. john didn't know the words to many songs. so i was valuable. i wrote up a few words and showed him how to play ""twenty flight rock"" and another one, i think. he played all this stuff and i remember thinking he smelled a bit drunk. quite a nice chap, but he was still a bit drunk. anyway, that was my first introduction, and i sang a couple of old things. i liked their band, and then one of their friends who was in the band, a guy called pete shotton who was a friend of john's, saw me cycling up in woolton one day and said, ""hey, they said they'd quite like to have you in the band, if you'd like to join."" i said, ""oh, yeah, it'd be great."" we then met up somewhere and i was in the band. i was originally on guitar. the first thing we had was at a conservative club somewhere in broadway, which is an area of liverpool, as well as new york. there was a conservative club there and i had a big solo, a guitar boogie. i had this big solo and it came to my bit and i blew it. i blew it. sticky fingers, you know. i couldn't play at all and i got terribly embarrassed. so i goofed that one terribly, so from then on i was on rhythm guitar. blown out on lead! we went to hamburg, and i had a real cheap guitar, an electric guitar. it finally blew up on me, it finally fell apart in hamburg. it just wasn't used to being used like that. then i was on piano for a little while. so i went from bass to lead guitar to rhythm guitar to piano. i used to do a few numbers like ray charles' ""don't let the sun catch you crying"" and a couple of jerry lee lewis' like ""high school confidential."" then stuart  left the group. he was the bass player. he lent me his bass, and i played bass for a few weeks. i used to play it upside down. and he used to have piano strings on it, because you couldn't get bass strings. they were a bit rare, you know, and they cost a lot, too, about ¢ for one string. so he would cut these big lengths of piano strings from the piano and wind them on this guitar. so i played that upside down for a while. i'm pretty versatile, i'll give that to myself. i wasn't very good, but i was versatile. i'm in hamburg, and i have a little bit of money together, and finally saved enough money to buy myself a hoffman violin bass. it was my bass, then, that was the one. and i became known for that bass, a lot of kids got them. that was my big pride and joy, because it sounded great. and that was it, basically. the rest you know. in america, the anthology album  and red rose speedway were back to back number ones. you were replacing yourself. did that strike you as odd? i thought it was good, rather than odd, because obviously the big hang up after the beatles broke up was, and really still is, can any of them be as good as the unit? the answer in most people's minds, i think, is ""no. they can't."" because the unit was so good. were you glad those anthology albums were released for the historical record or to combat the bootleggers? the bootlegging thing was one of the reasons. i didn't take an awful lot of interest in them, actually. i still haven't heard them. i know what's on them because i've heard it all before, you know. i haven't really taken much interest in beatles stuff of late just because there has been this hangover of apple and klein. the whole scene has gone so bloody sick. the four ex-beatles are totally up to here with it. everyone wants it solved so everyone can get on with being a bit peaceful with each other. there was a lawsuit recently, the three others against klein. of course i loved that. my god, i hope they win that one. that's great. you see, apart from everything that went down, all the little personal conflicts, the reason why i felt i had to do what i had to do, which ended up specifically as being i had to sue the other three, was that there was no way i could sue klein on his own, which is what i wanted to do. it took me months to get over the fact. i kept saying, i can't sue the other three, just because it's very hard news to go suing someone you like, and no matter what kind of personal things were going down and john writing songs about me and all that stuff, i still didn't feel like the coolest thing in the world was to go and sue them. but it actually turned out to be the only way to stop klein, so i had to go and do it. then it all started to come out, you know, that klein had persuaded george – i don't know how much of this is libelous – our lawyers will take out whatever is libelous. klein made his way into george's big songwriting company, which is george's big asset. the main one was the song ""something,"" that was on abbey road. that was kind of george's great big song, george's first big effort, and everyone covered it and it was lovely and made him lots of money that he could give away, which is his thing, you know. it was a great thing for him. well, it turns out that klein has got himself into that company. not only paid %  – there's a thought now that he's claiming he owns the company! it's those kinds of little weird trips. now the only good thing i feel is that i wasn't wrong. i would have felt really bad if i was wrong and the guy was really a goodie all along and i'd gone and stuck my big nose in there like the pot calling the kettle black. but it turns out he is the type of man who wants to own it for himself and not the type of man who believes the artist should have it and do what he wants with it, which is what i believe. he was once quoted in new york magazine as saying he was going to roast your ass. yeah, well, he never did, you know, and that's cool. he wouldn't get near my ass to roast it, anyway. punk. you mentioned you had to sue the other three to get at klein. what was klein doing that made you have to sue? basically, i was being held to my obligations under an old contract. i would have to just sit, lump it, and let him be my manager, which i didn't want. so i was told i could sue him. i said, ""great, i'll sue him."" then they said, ""there's one catch, you have to sue apple"" – and that meant suing the other three. for two months i sat around thinking, ""i can't do this."" not that i didn't see the others. i did, and kept asking them to let me out and they said, ""no, allen says there would be tax complications."" i said, ""i don't give a damn about tax considerations, let me go and i'll worry about the tax considerations. i didn't want to be an abkco-managed industry."" it was weird. my albums would come out saying ""an abkco company,"" and he wasn't even my manager. as it turns out, it was the best thing, because that got the receiver in there and froze the money and gave everybody time to think about it. he's still managed to get $ million transferred to his own company, five million for management . he has a very special gift for talking his way. he'll use his playboy interviews, and he'll probably ask for a rolling stone interview after mine. even a murderer has a great line in his own defense. but he's nothing more than a trained new york crook. john said, ""anyone whose record is as bad as this can't be so bad."" but that was lennon-esque crap, which john occasionally did; utter foolishness. klein had already been convicted on ten counts of income tax.  somebody who's been convicted ten times can't be all clean.  my back was against the wall. i'm not proud of it. but it had to be done. to him, artists are money. to me, they're more than that. if klein was the big reason for the breakup of apple, do you think there would have been difficulties anyway without him? i think there would have been difficulties. had the eastmans come in like i wanted, the others would have feared i was trying to screw everyone for the eastmans. it would have been a bit hard for the others to swallow, i'm afraid, since the eastmans were so close to me. but they didn't want to screw anybody, and the way it's turning out they're settling up most of it anyway. some people say, ""people are all the same in business,"" but they're not. i think the apple thing was great. as it turned out, the one thing about business is that it does have to be looked after. if you have paperwork and bills and royalties and accounts and stuff, they all have to be handled very well, or else things get lost and then accountants have great difficulty in making up the final picture for taxes. apple was together in a lot of other ways. although he didn't get treated brilliantly at apple, it was right for james taylor to make his first record then. i think it was shameful of them to sue him afterwards, but i think that was largely klein's instigation because of the way he works. he's kind of ""ok, git the bastard. he's left us and he's a success, let's sue him. we got him, we got his contract."" but i still think all the records that came out of it, billy preston and james taylor, badfinger, mary hopkin, all the people we did take on all had very good records. george, even with the radha krishna temple, i think that's great stuff. i don't think you can fault any of the artistic decisions. looking back on it i think it was really a very successful thing. the main downfall is that we were less businessmen and more heads, which was very pleasant and very enjoyable, except there should have been the man in there who would tell us to sign bits of paper. we got a man in who started to say, come on, sign it all over to me, which was the fatal mistake. just as i was going to do a radio show interview the other day, just as i was walking in, this feller walked up to me and said, ""hello, paul,"" and i thought i'd seen him somewhere before. he looked kind of middle-aged, , and i thought, ""what's he want with me? looks a bit dubious."" he pushed a little bit of paper in me hand, he said, ""i don't want to embarrass you, paul, i'm sure you know what this is all about, but i've got my job to do."" a wife and three kids, all that. so i walked on, muttering, looked at the bit of paper and it says ""abkco hereby sue you, john, george, ringo and everything you've ever been connected with,"" in so many words, companies i'd never even heard of. ""sue you all for the sum of $ million."" that is the latest little line. i'm not trying to be immodest by classing myself with van gogh or with the biggies in the artistic world, but it is just a pure continuation of that kind of story. the whole idea of whoever makes the thing not being given the profits of it isn't a new idea. i think it's a joke, trying to sue us for that amount of money. it is just purely that he thinks, in some way, that he owns us. the laugh is that on that whole klein thing there is one key thing which i luckily never would sign, so i feel a little bit out of that one, i must say. linda mentioned lew grade's claim that she couldn't write. that was an old one. around that time we had millions of suits flying here, flying there, george wrote the ""sue me, sue you blues"" about it. i'd kicked it all off originally, having to sue the other three beatles in the high court, and that opened pandora's box. after that everybody just seemed to be suing everybody. meanwhile lew grade suddenly saw his songwriting concessions, which he'd just paid an awful lot of money for, virtually to get hold of john and i, he suddenly saw that i was now claiming that i was writing half my stuff with linda, and that if i was writing half of it she was entitled to a pure half of it, no matter whether she was a recognized songwriter or not. i didn't think that was important, i thought that whoever i worked with, no matter what the method of collaboration was, that person, if they did help me on the song, should have a portion of the song for helping me. i think at the time their big organization suddenly thought, ""hello, they're pulling a fast one, they're trying to get some of the money back,"" whereas in fact, it was the truth. so they slapped vast amounts on us, i can't remember what. i wrote sir lew grade a long letter saying, ""don't you think i ought to be able to do this and do that and don't you think i've done enough and don't you think i'm ok, and – hey, man, why have you gotta sue me?"" he wrote me back a very rational letter. i can't remember exactly what it said, but it was a very nice letter. he's actually ok, lew, he's all right. you did a tv show for him. after it, yeah, that's right. all the suits were dropped by then. bit me tongue ... when was the last time you saw george? george? it's been a little while. had george invited you to the bangla desh benefit? george invited me, and i must say it was more than just visa problems. at the time there was the whole apple thing. when the beatles broke up, at first i thought, ""right, broken up, no more messing with any of that."" george came up and asked if i wanted to play bangla desh and i thought, blimey, what's the point? we're just broken up and we're joining up again? it just seemed a bit crazy. there were a lot of things that went down then, most of which i've forgotten now. i really felt annoyed – ""i'm not going to do that if he won't bloody let me out of my contract."" something like that. for years there had been problems as to why the other three felt they couldn't just rip up our partnership agreement. i thought it was crazy if we had split up as a band to have this piece of paper still going on. we were all tied into it and i wanted to break it up and they said, ""tax, you can't."" klein was saying, ""you can't do it, lads, you've got to stay together,"" and i think i know why he was saying it. he was telling the others it was tax and it was impossible and stuff. there was an awful lot of that, and a lot of what i did around about then was just out of bitterness at all that. i thought, ""this is crazy, no one likes me enough to just let me go, give me my little bit of the proceeds and let me split off."" it was a little tit-for-tat, if you're not going to do this for me, i'm not going to do that for you. i tend to see the others now just for business. it's a bit daft, actually. that's why i'm so hot to get these business things over with. you were hoping to do it today, i gather. yeah, there was a little thing ... you see, each time one of us will get hot for a meeting. say me, i just got me visa and i got all hot for a meeting. i rang john up, and john was keen to do it. he was going to fly in today from l.a. to new york. great! i was going to be here; john was going to be here. then i rang ringo, and ringo couldn't figure out what we were going to actually say, outside of ""hi, there."" and he didn't want to come all the way to new york from england, he was just getting settled for christmas. so he was a bit down on it, that kind of blew it out. then i called john and he said he was talking to george and george was having some kind of visa problems. so it's a bit difficult to get the four of us together. but it will happen soon. lee said that the show you'll do for phoenix house as part of the arrangement for your visa will be part of a tour. the only thing now, obviously, is that it's dependent on getting a band together. if we can get something together in the early months of , then we're hoping to come to the states, do a nice tour here. the phoenix house people helped to get me in. it's a good cause. we just went down to see one of their branches in east harlem, just now. it's fantastic. i wasn't thinking it would be much, i thought it would be a bit depressing. but it's a beautiful place. there's a lot of love in that place. and it's not the kind of a state thing. there's discipline, too, but the discipline comes out of love. that way no one minds the discipline. if you just start off with discipline and nothing else, a lot of the kids find it hard to do it. but they're all very self-supporting now. it's a great place, i must say. anyone who's in trouble with drugs, pills, junk or whatever, should take a look in the phoenix house. what was the reaction of the kids when you went in there? great. we just shook hands. their choir sang some songs and we went on a little tour of the house. there was a guy telling us about encounter meetings, how he was putting the bathroom in, doing all the plumbing himself – they're all very proud, because they're all people who almost messed up. they just made it, and most of them look like they can really go on to great strength because of it. would you like this to be a big proper tour or small, like your university tour? a big proper tour. i think if you're coming to the states, you can't do it funky. i don't think i could, anyway. i think now i'll be ready to do a big concert tour, although i find it hard to imagine at the moment. now that you're in new york, i suppose the rumors will start again. there'll be a beatles reunion of some sort? well, i must say, like as far as getting together as we were, as the beatles were, i don't think that'll ever happen again. i think now everyone's kind of interested in their little personal things. i kind of like the way we did band on the run, the way we did it. something we've never done before, and it's very interesting. but i do think that i for one am very proud – although i don't like the word proud, it tends to be – ex-servicemen have used the word ... if you know what i mean ... ""proud of my country"" ... but i will use the word – i am proud of the beatle thing. it was great and i can go along with all the people you meet on the street who say you gave so much happiness to many people. i don't think that's corny. at the time obviously it just passes over; you don't really think they mean it. oh, yeah, sure, and you shake their hand or whatever. but i dig all that like mad now, and i believe that we did bring a real lot of happiness to the times. so i'm very proud of that kind of stuff and consequently i wouldn't like to see my past slagged off. so i would like to see more cooperation.... if things go right, if things keep cool, i'd like to maybe do some work with them; i've got a lot of ideas in my head what i'd like, but i wouldn't like to tell you before i tell them. we couldn't be the beatles-back-together again, but there might be things, little good ventures we could get together on, mutually helpful to all of us and things people would like to see, anyway. i wouldn't rule everything out, it's one of those questions i really have to hedge on. but, i mean, i'm ready. once we settle our business crap – there was an awfully lot of money made, of course, and none of it came to us, really, in the end. virtually, that's the story. so i'd kind of like to salvage some of that and see that not everything's ripped off. through all that kind of bitterness i tended to think like john a bit, ""oh, the beatles ... naww ... crap."" but it really wasn't. i think it was great. so i'd like to see that cooled out and restored to its kind of former greatness, agree that it was a good thing and continue in some kind of way. i don't see gettin' the beatles back together – there's certain things we could do quite quietly and still produce some kind of ongoing thing. i don't think you'll ever get anyone to give up all their individual stuff now; everyone's got it going too well now. would you consider the ringo album an example of that type of cooperation? yeah, but i think more than that ... i think that's a beginning; that shows what someone can do just if he asks. that's all he did. he just asked us all. so that's what i like, that no one says, ""naw, you go on and make your own album."" so if it's that easy then lots of things could be done in the future. and i'd like to see some great things done. this story is from the january ,  issue of rolling stone.",1
342,"Beyoncé Is Pregnant With Twins, Let The Conspiracy Theories Commence","last night, the world officially went into meltdown after beyoncé announced she and jay z were expecting twins. with the help of contemporary artist awol erizku, queen bee shared her exciting news on social media, showing the veiled mother-to-be caressing her stomach, surrounded by reams of flowers, in what has now become the most liked instagram picture of all time. hours later, the rumour mill went into overdrive, with several conspiracy theories popping up. some of them questioning the timing of her announcement, others interpreting the instagram post like its a james joyce epic poem. soon, there will be more illuminati claims and eventually someone is bound to figure that she's not really pregnant at all and that it was all a ruse. let's have a look at the ideas that have been floated so far. firstly, many astute beyhive fans were quick to point out the lemonade star might have given us a hint about her pregnancy via instagram six weeks ago. in a post to instagram before christmas, the 'halo' singer shared a slideshow of photos of herself in a suede navy dress and silver antlers, which show her in back-to-back photos appearing to hold her stomach. in the clip, the star can be seen holding up a peace sign – or a number two – before making a heart shape with her hands. while it's plausible to believe the singer was simply sharing a message of peace and love to her fans during the festive seasons, rumours of the hidden baby announcement have now taken twitter by storm. meanwhile, other bey fans are suspicious of the pregnancy news' timing. next week, beyonce will attend the  annual grammy awards – an occasion particularly close to the singer's heart given the fact she's amassed  nominations and  wins over the years. following the unprecedented success of her sixth studio album lemonade, which has been nominated for staggering nine grammy awards this year, some fans are thinking her well-timed pregnancy announcement to be a clever pr stunt to prevent the news detracting from her award-winning album and grammy performance. after all, when beyonce opened her jacket to confirm her pregnancy following her rendition of love on top at the vmas in , it was this gesture – rather than the song – that naturally caught the world's attention. it is, of course, reasonable to assume that one of the most famous women in the world might have put some thought into the perfect way to time her pregnancy announcement to the world. but some of the theories that developed during her first pregnancy reached hilarious levels of fantasy. let's not forget that when ms. knowles-carter announced her first pregnancy with the now-five-year-old blue ivy carter, many people believed it to be fake, with talk of a shifting stomach during an appearance on an australian television show and suspicion as to the lack of pregnancy photos before the birth. this is the same woman who openly spoke out about the heartache of suffering a miscarriage before falling pregnancy with her first child, admitting the sound of her baby's heartbeat was 'the most beautiful music i ever heard in my life', during her hbo documentary life is but a dream. while it's unknown how far along the singer is in her second pregnancy, it's fairly traditional for a woman to keep the news hush hush until she's out of the first trimester. perhaps it is also worth considering that beyonce and jay z might have been cautious in sharing the news of their family growing at a time when civil, reproductive and women's rights are currently under threat by the trump administration in the us. in all fairness to beyoncé though, she's allowed to announce her news whenever she damn pleases really. just look at adele and eva mendes, who kept their pregnancies quiet until the actual births, making a statement about the fact that, even though celebrities are in the public eye, they and their families are not public property. some conspiracy theories can be quite fun, admittedly, mostly when they are completely inconceivable or bizarre, but for now, let's focus on the fact queen bee is about to welcome two of the coolest kids to the planet.",1

354,Justin Bieber's 'Purpose' show at Barclays Center lacks focus,"justin bieber may need to work a little harder on his focus. sure, keeping it together on a massive outing like his ""purpose"" tour night after night is tough. so it's understandable that his mic was at his side wednesday night when he was supposed to be singing, making it clear that he was lip syncing for at least part of the show. and there were points when he was standing still while his phalanx of  dancers were around him. but bieber forgot to sing his most recent no.  single ""love yourself"" in the middle of his show. ""i got a little ahead of myself,"" bieber said, as the stagehands rushed to return the sofa they had already removed as well as tuning his acoustic guitar again. ""should i skip it?"" of course, the capacity crowd screamed ""no!"" and, to his credit, bieber, a little red-faced, delivered a strong version of the song. though bieber pulled his career out of a tailspin with the recent string of three no.  hits from his album ""purpose,"" his concert at barclays center wednesday night showed that his career rebound hasn't solved all his problems. (bieber returns to barclays center again thursday, much to the chagrin of new york islanders fans whose playoff game is delayed until friday to accommodate the show.) the ""purpose"" tour is quite the spectacle, with its multilevel stage and elaborately choreographed routines. but bieber ends up being the center of attention and, at times, the weakest link. he opens the show in a massive glass box, and in one of the night's best moments, dances in a circular video screen that looks like he's trapped in a cage. no need for college-level performance art classes to figure out what that means. the show has its moments. with the upbeat ""get used to it"" seeming primed to be his next chart-topper. bieber looks energized when he's doing flips on a giant trampoline during ""company."" and the tropical-tinged dance numbers like ""what do you mean?"" and ""where are you now?"" hold up well, giving his faithful fan base plenty to scream about. they want him to succeed and most everyone loves a comeback. but before that becomes a secure possibility, bieber needs to find his ""purpose"" a little more interesting. set list: mark my words / where are ü now / get used to it / i'll show you / the feeling / boyfriend / untitled / home to mama / love yourself / been you / company / no sense / hold tight / no pressure / as long as you love me / drum solo / children / life is worth living / what do you mean? / baby / purpose // encore: sorry",1

""we also have friends who, when we've done barbecues and stuff, show up, like, dressed to the nines, like, 'this is the thing, right?,'"" theroux said. ""and we're like, 'no, this is actually just a barbecue.'"" on a happier note, though, theroux said he is relishing the fact that he is finally able to call aniston his wife.

372,Angelina Jolie on Cambodia 'awakening',"angelina jolie has spoken about how cambodia was her ""awakening"", as she premiered her new film in the country. the actress was speaking exclusively to the bbc before the screening of first they killed my father, a true-life account of the khmer rouge genocide through the eyes of a child. she said she hoped the film, which she directed, would help cambodians to speak more openly about the trauma of the period. jolie, now a un refugee agency special envoy, first visited cambodia for the filming of  hit lara croft: tomb raider. she later adopted maddox, her oldest son, from cambodia. ""i came to this country and i fell in love with its people and learned its history, and in doing so learned, how little i actually knew about the world,"" she told the bbc's yalda hakim. ""this country, for me was my awakening. ""i'll always be very grateful to this country. i don't think i ever could give back as much as this country has given me."" first they killed my father is based on a book of the same name by loung ung. ms ung was five when she and her family were forced to leave their home in the capital, phnom penh, by the khmer rouge, the regime which ran the country between  and , under pol pot. it is estimated that about two million people, around a quarter of the population, were either murdered by the regime or died from starvation and overwork. ""i thought that this war that happened  years ago, and what happened to these people, was not properly understood,"" said jolie. the film is predominantly in the local khmer language, and jolie said that while she wanted the wider world to better understand events in cambodia she hoped it would have an impact domestically too. ""i hope it helps the country speak more,"" she said, as many survivors ""haven't told their children their story"". the film, made by netflix, was given its world premiere on saturday inside the angkor temple complex in siem reap, where tomb raider was partly filmed. among those present alongside jolie and her six children was cambodia's king norodom sihamoni, who in  granted the actress cambodian citizenship for the work done by an environmental foundation she established in the country. the premiere was the first major public appearance for jolie since she filed for divorce from brad pitt in september last year, citing irreconcilable differences. the couple had been together since  but only married in august . ""it was very difficult,"" jolie said. ""many people find themselves in this situation. my whole family have all been through a difficult time. my focus is my children, our children. ""we are and forever will be a family and so that is how i am coping. i am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer."" oscars : what's up for best foreign language film? cambodia's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, on the back of a large garment sector producing clothes for some of the world's biggest brands. the government of long-time prime minister hun sen, himself a former khmer rouge cadre, takes credit for providing peace and development, but is accused of using heavy-handed tactics and the courts to subdue political opponents. a un-backed tribunal prosecuting senior khmer rouge leaders has convicted just a handful of people. pol pot died in . jolie recently wrote a piece for the new york times in response to us president donald trump's immigration ban, calling for her homeland to make decisions based on fact rather than fear. she was reluctant to talk specifically about mr trump but said: ""the american people are bigger than any president. i suppose i have faith in my country and in what it is founded on and the values we hold dear. ""i believe that many of the things that we're hearing that we feel are based on a sense of spreading fear or hate or dividing people by race or judgement is un-american. ""at this time i think what is amazing is we are seeing people around the world start to speak out for their civil liberties and rights and what they feel. in america, we are hearing people say 'this is un-american to me, this is unconstitutional to me. and this is who i am'.""",1

375,Robert Pattinson: 'Twilight's the hardest part I've done',"he made his name as teenage vampire heart-throb edward cullen in twilight. then his turbulent romance with co‑star kristen stewart dominated the world's gossip columns. now robert pattinson is older, wiser and shedding his hollywood pretty-boy image. he talks about his new role in david michôd's dystopian outback western the rover there is a moment in the rover, david michôd's futuristic western set in the australian outback, in which robert pattinson's character sits in the cab of a truck at night listening to the radio play keri hilson's hit pretty girl rock. the night is black and the radio tinny, and softly pattinson begins to sing along. ""don't hate me 'cause i'm beautiful,"" he sings, his voice high and whiny, the lyrics muffled by lips that cling to dirty teeth. ""don't hate me 'cause i'm beautiful."" it's a pivotal moment for rey, the slow, needy, uncertain young man pattinson plays, but it also feels like something of a reference point in the career of the actor himself; a small reminder for the audience of just how far he has run from his days as the pretty-boy hollywood pin-up. the pattinson who walks into our interview this morning seems to play a similar trick, pointing out, two steps into the room, that the hotel carpet ""looks like a magic eye picture"". and indeed it does – a bold, blurry pattern in stripes of cream and black. but pattinson's remark also serves to shifts attention neatly away from himself, as if he is weary of being the centre of it, the face that everyone stares at. pattinson was  when he was first cast as edward cullen in the twilight saga, the five-part movie adaptation of stephanie meyer's best-selling teen vampire novels. overnight he became one of hollywood's most adored young stars, pursued wherever he went by paparazzi and screaming fans. he was named ""the most handsome man in the world"" by vanity fair, and one of the  most influential people by time. amid all the fuss and the madness he embarked upon a tortuous relationship with his co-star, kristen stewart, that meant the young couple were rarely out of the gossip pages. he is  now. the final twilight instalment done, the stewart romance finished, he is finally cutting a dash as a serious actor. early leading-man roles (remember me; water for elephants) have given way to more challenging characters – he earned impressive reviews for his portrayal of a young billionaire in david cronenberg's adaptation of don delillo's cosmopolis, and will soon be seen in another cronenberg project, maps to the stars – as well as starring alongside nicole kidman in the gertrude bell biopic queen of the desert. but for now he is rooted in michôd's the rover, a brilliantly dark story of a loner (guy pearce) in pursuit of a gang of ramshackle crooks who have stolen his car. en route, he acquires rey (pattinson), the brother of one of the thieves, whom they had left for dead at the scene of a botched robbery, and together they chug through the australian desert, now a glowering, lawless land  years after a global economic collapse. ""i just thought it was strikingly original,"" pattinson says of first reading michôd's script. ""even in the way it looked on the page. ""david's got a very specific way of writing dialogue. it's very functional, the writing's very harsh, it's savage, but it didn't feel just stylised writing – it was emotional as well. it just seemed so natural compared to something like no country for old men. i always felt that was more like film writing. and this didn't really feel like a film script – it felt like a dream."" pattinson has a very particular way of speaking: he will talk softly, intently about subjects you sense mean a great deal to him – michôd's writing, for instance, or the craft of acting – only to then sweep it to one side with a flourishing ""it was crazy!"" or a burst of wheezy, slightly wild laughter. it gives the impression of someone who has not quite yet settled into his skin. he had to audition for the rover – a process he loathes. ""i'm quite good at doing meetings,"" he says. ""if i'm just meeting someone about a job i'm like a dog, especially if my agent's said to me: 'a lot of people want this job.' then i'm like: 'oh yeah? then i will do anything to get it!'"" what's his technique? ""i don't know, i just become a bullshit artist!"" he laughs. ""that's when i start acting! i'm really much better at doing it when the cameras aren't rolling ..."" but auditions petrify him. he has spoken of the good  minutes of ""neuroses"" he has to suffer before any audition can ever really begin. ""i just can't ... i literally can't do it,"" he tries to explain. ""it's just me looking uncomfortable, trying to put on an american accent ... or sitting in the corner, making myself throw up and punching myself in the face."" what helps get him past the neuroses, what happens after those excruciating  minutes that helps him perform. ""just that you think that someone actually believes you can do something,"" he says. ""that makes me sound like such an idiot. it's crazy."" but the joys of acting still outweigh these moments. ""for whatever reason, i think there's something profoundly satisfying about being able to watch something you've done afterwards, or to just do a scene and feel like: 'oh, i just had an out-of-body experience for a second!'"" he pauses. ""just for one second,"" he says gently. ""and generally people don't even notice. it feels literally like you've been asleep for a second."" he recalls such a moment while shooting this film. ""it's not the biggest scene, it's not even in the movie, it was the rehearsal. and me and guy had just been going so nuts – we'd been out in the desert and we'd become like crazy homeless people. and i turned around and looked at him and just realised actually, we're not acting any more."" he laughs. ""and why did that feel so good? it's so weird."" it's easy to assume that being tethered to the long-running twilight saga held him back from experiencing such moments, from growing as an actor, but he argues that the role required more resources than most. ""i think twilight's probably the hardest part i've done,"" he says, ""because to do it for five movies, it's really hard to think of stuff that's maybe not boring. especially if you don't die. because what's the drama? you're not scared of anything! and that's the whole essence of drama: life and death."" pattinson was born and raised in london, but many of his film roles have required an us accent. in the rover, rey is from the american south, and like many has relocated to australia in search of work in the mines. it was the voice, he says, that led him into the character. he recalls ""losing my mind"" during his first day on set. ""it just didn't feel right for ages,"" he says. ""and then there was this one little thing – i had this makeup on my teeth, and it kept rubbing off all the time. it was really putting me off – it meant i had to keep redoing scenes. so i started trying to do this thing where i covered my teeth with my lips. and it changes your voice a little bit, but i thought: 'oh, that's really cool!' and after that i started speaking like that 'ouhhggghhh ...'"" he replicates the style, and then laughs. ""it's so silly, it's so stupid! i was just kind of making the accent up, i don't even know what state it is really."" but for pattinson, having the opportunity to play a grubby-toothed mumbler from an unidentified corner of the american south proved liberating, as did the fact that his character plays second fiddle to that of pearce. ""there's something about rey, and there's something about not having to drive the story forward,"" he explains. ""you can just be the condiment. it's really kind of freeing just being the sidekick weirdo."" he is full of praise for pearce, for his physicality and his ability to transform himself for the role. he speaks of how, for much of their time on set, he thought pearce to be physically bigger, and of his strange surprise when filming ended to find him not only clean-shaven but also somehow reduced in stature. ""and i liked seeing that guy, even after having done tons and tons of movies is still scared,"" he adds. ""i've worked with some actors who, having done so many movies, they just know what they're gonna do. no matter what i would be doing in a scene they would have practised their part in a mirror already and that was it, whereas guy is really trying to find it still. so that was why it was more fun – because neither of us really knew what the movie was about when we started. but he's not afraid to let it happen. and there's very few actors who've been doing it as long as he has that still approach it like that, that still have that element of danger."" how did they find out what the movie was about? ""i think it's about the feel,"" pattinson says. ""i think after i did cosmopolis i realised that trying to psychoanalyse parts and trying to be all clever about it ... well, it only really started with actors in the , and for thousands of years before that it was just about voice and using your body as a performance instrument ..."" he gives a faintly embarrassed laugh. ""so i generally think whatever feels nice, it's probably right."" what felt nice in this role was the language, he says. ""it was all the little speech patterns. it was like a song - if you're singing a song in a certain way you're not trying to make it sound sad or something, it just is."" he frowns. ""i keep trying to do that in movies, but it's really difficult trying to find scripts that allow for it, that mean you don't have to hit specific thematic beats."" occasionally he tries to write something himself. ""i was trying to write a play the other day and i showed it to my assistant and didn't quite realise how bad it was."" he laughs and laughs. ""i was writing it totally by myself in the middle of the night thinking: 'this is how you do it! you just stay up all night and keep writing!' she came in the next morning, and i'd been up all night writing. i said to her: 'you have to read this! it's amazing!'"" he could tell it was perhaps not, he says, from her facial expressions as she read. ""and then she said: 'it's not in english ... and half the time you haven't even put the character names in so it's just a stream of consciousness ...'"" but he would like to be in a play, he says. ""something in a really small theatre. i don't think i could do something on broadway ... but i'd quite like to do something kind of shocking."" he likes being shocking, he says, and his next role is satisfyingly so. starring alongside robert de niro in olivier assayas's idol's eye, he will play a small-time criminal caught up with the chicago mafia. ""my character is this slightly delusional lost child,"" he says. ""everyone always glamorises criminals – it feels inevitable in movies – but in this it's really not glamorised. it is quite dense. it's really serious. very political."" i think of something he told me earlier, about the ways in which he believes twilight has influenced his career, and of how he wagers that most cinema audiences have judged him before he has uttered a single line on the screen. i pictured his frustration, the effort of forever trying to shake off that famous role, but on the contrary, he explained, he enjoys the possibilities that tension brings. ""it's kind of fun,"" he said. ""because people have preconceived ideas about you, and sometimes it affords you the opportunity to shock people more.""",1

381,"Taylor Swift's 'Reputation': All the gossip about Joe Alwyn, Kanye West and Tom Hiddleston","in the preface of her two reputation-themed magazines, which feature photos, poetry and hand-written lyrics to celebrate the release of her sixth album, swift lamented the inevitable news stories that guess at the targets of her lyrics. “when this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test,” she wrote. “there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it’s  and if you didn’t see a picture of it, it couldn’t have happened right?” yet, even with its controversy-winking title, reputation is probably the least-gossipy release of swift’s career. instead of an array of songs potentially referencing different ex-lovers, the majority of reputation is dedicated to a single subject, whom swift is still (as far as fans know) happily dating. the allusions to swift’s past dramas are few and far between, and when they do show up on reputation, they make for some of the album’s very best songs. swift steers clear of katy perry and squad drama and bashing her exes, keeping her apologies short, and list of enemies shorter. more: taylor swift, pop princess, wins song of the year at the cma awards swift is a master at chronicling her soured relationships, with many of her finest songs memorializing (and sometimes flaming) her exes. so what happens when swift writes an album about a person she’s still into? that’s the story of reputation, and the british actor joe alwyn, whom swift has been spotted with over the past year, is the man at its center. “oh,  years old / oh, how were you to know,” swift sings on dancing with our hands tied, referencing alwyn’s age at the time she wrote the album (he's  now). the “ocean blue eyes” swift sings about on gorgeous almost certainly belong to alwyn, a motif that repeats on dancing with our hands tied (“deep blue, but you painted me golden”) and delicate (“oh damn, never seen that color blue”). swift also mentions his british roots in gorgeous when she sings, “you should take it as a compliment that i got drunk and made fun of the way you talk,” calling herself his “american queen” on king of my heart and teasing, “do the girls back home touch you like i do?” on delicate. and beyond songs like gorgeous and delicate that deliberately reference alwyn, swift spends the majority of reputation lusting after, falling in love with and eventually pledging her loyalty to her new beau, the most time she’s ever spent on a romantic upswing on one of her albums. taylor swift and kanye west (and her squad) swift came out of the gate swinging on reputation's lead single look what you made me do, with lyrics like ""i don’t like your little games / don’t like your tilted stage"" that seemed directed at west, the rapper who reignited their feud when he unceremoniously included swift's name in his famous lyrics. with an album title like reputation, fans speculated whether the entire album would be a vindictive screed aimed at swift's enemies. turns out, look what you made me do was a red herring, and west barely makes an appearance in the album's lyrics, save for one other song in which swift laughing at the rapper as she dances on his grave. the album's third-to-last track, this is why we can’t have nice things, is a postmortem of swift's  era, when she partied with her squad members on instagram and was buddy-buddy with west, before  arrived and swift's public persona took a hit. ""it was so nice throwing big parties / jump into the pool from the balcony,"" swift begins, remembering ""feeling so gatsby for that whole year"" before she gets to the chorus, singing with a smirk in her voice, ""this is why we can’t have nice things, darling / because you break them."" then, it's west's turn. ""it was so nice being friends again / there i was giving you a second chance / but you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand,"" she sings, referencing their fateful phone call about famous that west's camp recorded and later posted to smear her as duplicitous. ""but i’m not the only friend you’ve lost lately / if only you weren’t so shady,"" she continues, raising a toast to her real friends, her mother, and then eventually to west. ""and here’s to you, 'cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do,"" she says, before breaking down in giggles, saying, ""i can’t even say it with a straight face!"" this is why we can’t have nice things may be an enjoyable slice of pettiness, but the album's crown jewel of gossip is getaway car, which sees swift in full storyteller mode as she chronicles using one doomed relationship to escape another. with lyrics like “i wanted to leave him, i needed a reason” and ""with three of us, honey, it’s a sideshow,"" the song seems to reference the several months in  when swift parted ways with calvin harris and dated tom hiddleston immediately after, before eventually splitting with him too. to follow the song's metaphor, hiddleston is the getaway car driver who whisks swift away from another man (""well he was running after us / i was screaming ‘go go go!'""). in the end, she leaves him too, escaping with the fortune and singing, ""i put the money in a bag and stole the keys / that was the last time you ever saw me."" swift may not want fans to linger on the gossip behind her songs, but when it's as wonderfully told as getaway car, honestly, who can blame them?",1
382,Here's How Caitlyn Jenner Celebrated Father's Day,"caitlyn jenner took father’s day to the extreme—by going off-roading with members of her family. “great day yesterday for father’s day,” she tweeted, along with a photo. “we had so much fun off-roading. so much love and support! love my family!” from left to right, that’s burt jenner and girlfriend valerie, caitlyn jenner, kim kardashian, kanye west with baby north, khloé kardashian, kendall jenner, brandon jenner and his wife, leah felder. both kendall and her sister kylie tweeted father’s day tributes to caitlyn jenner, who came out as transgender this year and recently covered vanity fair magazine. “happy father’s day my little light of sunshine. ‘you can still call me dad, kylie. no matter what i’m always going to be your father. that’s never going to change,'” kylie wrote. “my whole life this soul was my daddy and just because your appearance is different now doesn’t mean you were any less of a father to me my entire life,” kendall wrote. “happy father’s day to the person who raised me, and taught me everything i know, my hero.”",1
383,Tom Hanks Officiated Allison Williams‘s Wedding to Ricky Van Veen,"allison williams wasn’t on hand to cheer on her girls co-stars at the emmy awards on sunday night, but she probably didn’t miss the spectacle—she was too busy celebrating being a newlywed. the actress’s wedding to collegehumor co-founder ricky van veen took place at a wyoming ranch on saturday, and so far—like a true millennial—all she’s shared about the big event is this instagram, featuring her custom oscar de la renta gown. people had more details, including that tom hanks was the officiant (his wife rita wilson plays marnie’s mom on girls) and other guests included katy perry, john mayer, bruce springsteen, seth meyers, diane von furstenberg, barry diller, mindy kaling, and of course, girls co-stars lena dunham and jemima kirke. dunham’s instagram included some shots of the road trip to and from the wyoming ranch, but none of the event itself. if williams were more like her girls character, we could probably expect an entire album of weepy singer-songwriter tracks about the big day. but the real williams, thankfully, will probably celebrate much more like a normal person—and hopefully share a few more instagrams for the rest of us whose invitations were surely lost in the mail.",1
384,"Oscars: Mel Gibson, Casey Affleck and Hollywood's Sliding Scale of Moral Punishment","the men's restroom of the landmark theatres in west l.a. is as good a place as any to gauge the true sentiments of oscar voters. following a showing of hacksaw ridge a few saturdays ago, i found myself washing my hands next to two gentlemen — both appeared to be about , the average age of academy members, with one wearing a kung fu panda  cap (the kind of hat a grown man doesn't wear unless he worked on the movie) discussing what they had just seen. ""didn't want to like that one but ... ,"" the first man said, trailing off. ""but mel can direct,"" the friend finished. i knew instantly why they were conflicted. this season, admiration for hacksaw ridge as an emotional and deftly staged world war ii action drama has come despite the fact that its filmmaker has made anti-semitic and misogynistic comments. hacksaw is one of several films in the awards race featuring marquee talent with personal issues in their pasts, highlighting the age-old concern of whether voters should judge the man (and yes, they're all men in this situation), his work or a combination of both? like my two restroom pals, awards voters so far this season have been embracing gibson. hacksaw ridge has landed on the afi top  list and earned seven critics' choice and three golden globe noms, including best picture (drama) and best director for gibson. it's a pretty remarkable turn for a filmmaker who, just six years ago, was fired by his own agents. at the same time, awards bodies (aside from the naacp, which nominated it for six image awards) and critics groups have ignored the birth of a nation, a film that just  months ago was lauded by many tastemakers as a sure-fire best picture nominee and the antidote to #oscarssowhite. but that was before the details of filmmaker-star nate parker's college rape trial resurfaced this summer, along with the news that his accuser had committed suicide. so low have birth's awards prospects sunk that the film didn't even appear on lists of globe or sag award snubs. and fox searchlight, which typically hosts a ""holiday party"" to allow its talent to mingle with voters, turned this season's soiree into a celebration of jackie, its other contender, ignoring birth. why do some personal troubles stick to movies while others seem to not bother voters? that question has arisen throughout oscar history. russell crowe's assault of a bafta producer is said to have cost him an oscar for 's a beautiful mind, but in , roman polanski won best director for the pianist even though he couldn't accept his award in person because he is a fugitive from justice after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, then , in . this year, these issues haven't only swirled around gibson, parker and, to a lesser extent, woody allen, whose latest film, cafe society, arrived at cannes amid renewed allegations by his son ronan farrow that allen had sexually abused ronan's sister dylan. some have questioned why casey affleck, a best actor frontrunner for his powerful performance in manchester by the sea, has not been subject to nate parker-style scrutiny for the two sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him in  by a female producer and a director of photography who claimed affleck tormented them during the making of the bizarre mockumentary i'm still here. dp magdalena gorka's suit claimed she was made to suffer ""a nearly daily barrage of sexual comments, innuendo and unwelcome advances by crewmembers, within the presence and with the active encouragement of affleck."" affleck denied the allegations and settled the suits for a reported $ million. so far, he's picked up a gotham award and a critics' choice win. some have insinuated that parker's race played a role in his banishment, either consciously or subconsciously. and they may be right. another factor might be the especially shocking nature of the claims against him, despite his acquittal, or his refusal in media interviews to apologize, or the fact that sexual assault is dramatized in his film. but it might also be the clubby nature of hollywood that forgives those perceived as insiders and gives no benefit of the doubt to those who aren't. affleck, a hollywood presence for almost as long as his brother ben, is an insider. gibson, movie star and best picture winner for braveheart, is another insider. he was sent to directors jail for a decade before reemerging this year, and voters seem to be saying enough time has passed. also, his movie is really good. this time of year, it's all about getting voters to actually see the contenders. and while one oscar-nominated producer recently told me he felt an ""ickiness"" when deciding to pop in his hacksaw screener, he did it anyway and liked the film. this same producer didn't think twice about watching manchester. but, like many, he hasn't even bothered to open his birth of a nation screener.",1
385,Guy Ritchie enjoys laid-back bike ride with son Rocco amid claims ex-wife Madonna is 'close to agreeing a deal for the teen to stay in London',"madonna and guy ritchie are battling for custody of son, , through court judge in manhattan court told them to solve dispute themselves rocco currently lives with father in london and says he wants to stay there source claims madonna close to agreeing, so long as he visits us regularly guy was spending quality time with his son amidst legal drama it was recently reported that madonna is close to agreeing a deal for her son rocco to stay in london with his father guy ritchie after a judge laid into them for dragging the dispute through the courts. and the filmmaker appeared unfazed as he spent some quality time with his -year-old in the english capital, enjoying a leisurely bike ride in the midst of the ongoing cross-atlantic custody battle. guy and rocco were clad in matching waterproof jackets and grey hoodies as they indulged in some gentle exercise following the stress of the court hearing earlier this week. the man from u.n.c.l.e director topped off his athletic look with a beanie hat, while rocco sported a baseball cap. the teen - who has been living with his father in london since fleeing his mother's rebel heart tour in december - was busy checking his phone as he cycled along behind his dad. rocco is adamant he wants to continue living with his father in london, and it's claimed madonna is close to agreeing to a deal. the pair have been fighting for custody since december, culminating with madonna's lawyers calling for mr ritchie to be arrested this week. but sources say madonna is close to agreeing a deal to let rocco stay in the uk with his father, , so long as he returns to the us for regular holidays. as news of the deal emerged, madonna posted a bizarre video of herself online with the caption 'tears of a clown'. the -second video shows the singer spinning and tap-dancing on a catwalk in a red polka-dot suit and mask. the deal could finally be an end to the dispute which has been dragged through the courts since december, when the -year-old refused to go back to new york to see his mother. a source close to the couple said: 'it's obvious they can't force rocco to return and the judge was told he's too old to be forced,' reports the sun. 'but madonna wants to make sure she regularly sees him and they spend time together. they are just looking at the final details now like public holidays.' just yesterday, lawyers for madonna demanded that the star's ex-husband guy ritchie be arrested for contempt of court for not abiding terms agreed in their divorce in . her legal team made the dramatic demand during a bitter court hearing in new york which both she and ritchie were listening to by phone. madonna's lawyer eleanor alter said that ritchie should have brought rocco to new york to resolve the dispute, because he was required to according to terms in the legally-binding divorce. she said: 'he taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and i think that's one of the most serious things that's happened in this case that's detrimental to rocco.' alter said that ritchie's conduct was 'contempt' and the court went so far as to discuss the possibility that a warrant could be issued for ritchie's arrest. she added that the contempt should be enforced but new york supreme court justice deborah kaplan refused to issue the warrant for ritchie's arrest. ritchie's lawyer peter bronstein angrily rejected the demand from madonna's team and said that his client had not even been held in contempt so an arrest was not being considered yet. justice kaplan scolded both ritchie and madonna and said their son just wanted the case over. she said: 'frankly both parties have chosen to live their lives in a very public way and may welcome the publicity, but the child has not. 'he would like this matter resolved and the issues concerning him and his family in the most private way possible'. lawyers for both sides grew increasingly ill-tempered as the hearing went on. see more of the latest madonna updates as she fights for custody of her son rocco alter, for madonna, said that things she had been told by mr bronstein about english law had 'proved to be incorrect' and that some of the 'protections' she'd hoped for had not materialised. she said that did not have an agreement on 'any part' of the case. mr bronstein said that ritchie and madonna had been speaking directly to each other and by yesterday had drawn up an agreement which they had summarized into  points. it broke down because of a number of issues including measures that allowed david banda, the son madonna adopted while married to ritchie, to visit rocco in london but make sure he returns to new york. mr bronstein said there were still a 'number of differences which are extremely important to my client and, i understand, to the child'. he went on to say that he had refrained from filing a number of papers which could be 'emotionally disturbing' to rocco in the hope that an agreement could be reached. he asked the court to lift justice kaplan's order from december requiring that rocco return to new york but she rebuffed him. justice kaplan told him that under the terms of madonna and ritchie's divorce, which was agreed in london in , the manhattan supreme court had ultimate authority over any custody matters, not the high court in london. instead ritchie has been going to the london court for hearings over the row, the court was told. another one was due to take place in london on thursday. justice kaplan urged both sides not to take up what she called 'entrenched' positions and think about what was 'best for the child'. she said that she thought that both parties were 'coming very very close to a global resolution that would take the child out of the unending spotlight'. alter seized on this and said that ritchie's conduct amounted to contempt. she said: 'he thought it was better for rocco to live with him. 'he may be right, i don't know. but the proper procedure was to come back to new york and ask for a change in circumstances. he used self-help. 'he taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and i think that's one of the most serious things that's happened in this case that's detrimental to rocco.' mr bronstein said that the mere suggestion ritchie could be arrested cast a 'dark pall' over the hearing and said that the boy should be able to live in a 'normal household' with his father present. rocco's lawyer ellen sigal said that the teenager wanted his parents to 'put in place measures that will heal the rift that has arisen'. she said that the case was proving to be a 'very difficult' time for him and that that she hoped he would not be exposed to any more 'distress and innuendo'. she said that rocco felt that the case was 'stressful and upsetting'. he is currently attending school in london and that she hoped rocco's parents 'come to an agreement that will shield him from this matter'. madonna appeared by phone from new zealand where she is due to play the next date in her rebel heart tour. ritchie's location was not disclosed but is likely to have been london. she spoke only at the start of hearing when asked: 'is that miss ciccone?' and she replied: 'yes, it's me.' ritchie only spoke to confirm he was on the phone too. earlier justice kaplan had agreed to let the press remain in the court because she did not believe that coverage of the case would cause a 'negative impact' to rocco. she said that the case had attracted 'extraordinary' media attention and that she had to balance the need for public access with the 'harmful effects' on rocco. the judge also allowed a single photographer in to take still photos of the hearing. the case is to resume on  june. the couple were married in skibo castle in scotland in a high profile ceremony attended by gwyneth paltrow, donatella versace and stella mccartney. madonna is also the mother to -year-old daughter lourdes leon, from her previous relationship to carlos leon, and adopted children david banda, , and mercy james, also  - david was adopted while she was still married to guy. guy, meanwhile, has gone on to have three children with wife jacqui ainsley: sons rafael, four, and levi, one, and daughter rivka, three. ritchie had been seen walking in london before the case was heard. he and his superstar singer ex have been embroiled in a bitter legal battle over their teenager for the past few months. madonna has used social media to attempt to appeal to her son. two weeks ago she shared a nostalgic snapshot of herself with baby rocco, reminiscing about happier times. along with the snap, she wrote, 'tu me manque............(sic)', translated as 'i miss you'. while some of her french fans were quick to point out that she had spelt 'manques' wrong, most of her followers chimed in with messages of love and support, reassuring the star that rocco would no doubt change his mind. 'be strong he will come back, he is just a teenager', one posted, while another enthused, 'he will always be your son and you always his mother'. rocco is said to have moved in which his father, , his model wife jacqui ainsley, , and their three children after becoming fed up with being on tour with his mother. he was supposed to spend christmas with her but did not return home to new york. madonna went to the manhattan supreme court in december to try to force rocco to come home. but during the hearing ritchie's lawyer eric buckley said that rocco had 'expressed very clearly' that he did not want to be with her. one possible source of rocco's frustration is that madonna posted numerous pictures and videos of him on instagram that could have caused him embarrassment. in may she posted one video of him doing a backflip wearing orange underwear with the caption 'rocco's preferred profile #nosausage'. in an interview in august madonna said that rocco did not want to perform on stage with her and would be working backstage on her tour as 'your mom is not cool' at his age. the row has reopened old wounds from her and guy's divorce after eight years together and put madonna at the center of a painful and public battle. madonna reportedly thinks guy's parenting is too lax and is said to have hired private detectives to spy on rocco, who took pictures of him smoking underage.",1

388,Who could succeed Anna Wintour at US Vogue?,"as rumours that sarah jessica parker will succeed anna wintour at us vogue are shot down, we ask: who could step into wintour's manolo blahniks when the time comes? it's possibly the most ludicrous fashion rumour we've ever heard but claims that anna wintour has been grooming sarah jessica parker as her replacement at us vogue got us thinking: who will replace her when she eventually leaves? wintour's will be some metaphorically big shoes to fill, she is american vogue. here we place our bets... victoria beckham: the chameleon she's come a long way since her days as a zig-a-zig-ah-ing spice girl and now sits firmly at the top of the international fashion tree. who's to say she can't morph into a magazine editor next? anna dello russo: the exchange programme can you imagine vogue in the hands of the woman that brought us 'fashion shower'. wouldn't it be amazing? a stalwart fashion editor, dello russo certainly has the vision, even if it is a bit, umm, outrageous. amy astley: the safe choice the editor-in-chief of vogue's little-sister publication teen vogue, amy astley has worked with wintour before when she was a beauty editor at vogue. well respected in fashion circles, astley would be a very safe pair of hands to leave big vogue in. natalie massenet: the business guru the founder of net-a-porter, natalie massanet is an omnipotent presence in british fashion as the chair of the bfc. however, she's us-born, used to be a fashion editor at tatler and she's got wintour's seal of approval. ""natalie's doing a very good job,"" said the editor-in-chief of massenet's impact on london fashion week. ""she's a very organised person and she's obviously having an impact on where the shows are located."" eva chen: the protegée when wintour became artistic director of condé nast she immediately bumped former beauty editor eva chen up to editor of lucky, one of conde nast's us titles. chen is very well known, and liked, in the industry meaning the top title at vogue may well be hers one day. marc jacobs: the curveball think about it. ""he's opinionated and has some spare time now ,"" says lisa armstrong, ""also a brilliant stylist in addition to knowing what we all want to wear."" tamara mellon: the all-rounder the jimmy choo co-founder has business savvy and a creative mind. since setting up her eponymous label (in nyc, no less) she knows how to stand up to a boardroom of investors and get ideas off the ground. plus she's glamorous, supremely well-connected and used to work at british vogue. tonne goodman: the internal hire surrounded by british-born counterparts at us vogue, goodman, the magazine's fashion director is like a fresh breath of manhattan air. styling tricky celebrities is her bread and butter, and no-one understands the demands of the high-earning american woman better than she. roger federer: the sporty spice ok, this suggestion is as likely as andy murray winning wimbledon (oh... hang on) but the tennis supremo attends shows with anna, while she cheers him on from the stands. he certainly knows how to wear a suit, and has probably learnt more than meets the eye from those fashion soirees the two love to hang out at. john galliano: the provocateur a curveball perhaps but it's well known that anna is a huge supporter of galliano's. it was her that got him his first post-scandal job at oscar de la renta and what better way to bring him back to the top than to seat him in her big, shiny editor's office? lena dunham: the voice of a generation dunham is us vogue's current flavour of the month, quite literally, as she appears on the february cover - the result of months of wooing by wintour, apparently. often dubbed 'the voice of her generation', she would certainly bring a new voice. lucy yeomans: the brit pick yeomans was appointed editor of harper's bazaar in the uk when she was just  years of age. now masterminding the launch of net-a-porter.com's first print magazine, porter, fashion journalism runs through her veins. meryl streep: when life imitates art as the telegraph's fashion editor lisa armstrong comments: ""if we're choosing editors based on the fact they once played writers, what about someone who actually played an er, editor - meryl streep?"" a valid point we're sure you'll agree. stefano tonchi: the editor's choice italian-born tonchi would be a publisher's dream; he's the current editor of style bible w (also owned by conde nast) and has previously worked at esquire, l'uomo vogue and edited t: the new york times style magazine. he moves in similar circles to wintour and would be editorially-focused.",1

395,"Who Is Mark Billingham? The Bodyguard Claims He ""Fathered"" Brangelina's Kids","since the news of brad pitt and angelina jolie's split, many have wondered what will happen to the couple's six kids. will they stay with mom, or with dad, or some combination of the two? or could a third person have parenting rights as well? enter mark billingham, the star couple's bodyguard. billingham said he basically ""fathered"" the children, according to us weekly. of course, billingham is not asking for custody — and even if he did, he probably wouldn't be awarded it, considering he's not related by blood to the kids, and he was only with the family for  months. but it's interesting that the guard would choose to come forward with the details of his employments now, especially amidst some rumors of pitt's shortcomings as a father. according to billingham, the couple's primary concern was their children. they wanted the guard to keep the six kids — maddox, ; pax, ; zahara, ; shiloh, ; and -year-old twins knox and vivienne — safe, particularly from kidnapping. a former member of the british army, billingham described the couple's intense protectiveness of their children. pitt and jolie didn't want the kids spending time or going anywhere with strangers. they were also worried about stalkers who could endanger the lives of their children, according to the sun. but billingham said he was was one member of their staff that the couple allowed to get close to the kids, according to the sun: billingham said he became so close with the kids that he was an ""unofficial"" father. but he didn't throw any shade at pitt, whose parenting style some questioned after jolie filed for divorce. e! news reported that pitt was under investigation by the los angeles police department and the department of children and family services as a result of allegations that the actor verbally and physically abused the children. the allegations have not been substantiated. from what billingham describes of his relationship to the couple and their children, it's clear that pitt and jolie want what's best for their children. in her divorce filing, jolie did cite the well-being of the kids as a reason for the split. pitt, in his response, also emphasized his commitment to the couple's children. hopefully, with the right support system — perhaps including people like billingham — the kids will get through the divorce alright.",1
396,Kim Kardashian Opens Up to About Life After the Paris Robbery,"this morning, kim kardashian west is a few minutes late to breakfast because she can’t get this gel-mask thing off her face. she’s staying in a room in the upper reaches of the baccarat hotel in midtown manhattan. a room with a giant bed in it, in which she slept, butt to butt, with her four-year-old daughter, north. and in that room she applied a mask — of the cosmetic variety, not the halloween variety — only to discover she couldn’t really get it off. where did she get this gold gel-mask thing that’s supposed to make your skin healthier? man, when you’re kim kardashian west, you don’t know where everything comes from. people just give you stuff. the vaults and doors and express-delivery accounts of the world open and a free flow of stuff just washes over you. kim tries to enjoy it, because that’s the enlightened thing to do. but right now she’s upstairs in her room trying to separate her face from the free gel-mask thing. it is  a.m. i wait for her in the sumptuous lobby. baccarat, for those who do not shop for $, vases, is a french company that makes crystal. and being inside the baccarat hotel is like being inside a fine crystal lamp where an urbane french genie who wears louis vuitton suits lives. here’s the kind of place it is: $ from le menu du petit déjeuner at the petit salon in the hotel gets you two eggs, potatoes, bacon, juice, and…coffee! there is an actual crown on display on a shelf full of curios and crystals, unless it’s the world’s most bejeweled serving dome. but kim k. does not make me wait too long. seven minutes after , she arrives. she looks somehow naked. her face, anyway. it is scrubbed clean, i guess from the mask removal. there is a stunning absence of makeup, except for some lip balm that she tells me she got in iceland. which is ironic given that the -year-old recently launched her own makeup line (it’s called kkw beauty ). predictably, she has utterly crushed the stuff-for-your-face market the way she has crushed all other markets. i think part of the reason her facial nudity is so striking is that being simple and unadorned isn’t really her role. her role is more queen of america . (married to the king of…hip-hop fashion, intellectual provocation, and possible public-­insanity performance art?) queen of instagram, queen of a certain type of television, queen of relevance. the queen of calabasas, california! which, if you don’t know, is the mount olympus of our time. will smith lives there. and justin bieber and drake and the rock and the osbournes. and if you think about who’s the queen of those people, wouldn’t you say kim kardashian west? i know, you’re probably wondering what she was wearing. you’re probably saying to yourself: what did she eat for breakfast? i’m not going to make you wait for it. she wears this cool, rocky balboa retro gray cotton hoodie with the  american olympic team logo on it and gray sweatpants. and she orders scrambled eggs with tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions mixed in, an english muffin, and some english breakfast tea with loads of honey. did she eat everything? don’t be afraid to wonder. if you don’t care whether kim kardashian west ate her english muffin, you need to go back to kim kardashian west school so you can appreciate the wonderful granular gossipyness that’s part of what’s so enjoyable about knowing everything about kim k. before you come back here with your too-good-to-want-to-know-if-she-eats-her-english-muffin-ness. “i’m, like, the most fit i’ve ever been,” she says. how do you get in shape if you’re kim k.? the same way you do everything: instagram. you go and you find “this bodybuilder on instagram” and you contact her. you find someone who, as kim k. tells it, “had an amazing transformation after she had a baby.” and kim k. happened to be in the market for a really amazing transformation after giving birth. now kim’s working out an hour and a half a day. kim kardashian west — i don’t want to scandalize you — has had her picture taken nearly naked before. for playboy . and completely nude for paper, gq, and w magazines. and that doesn’t even include the original document of her fame, the storied ray j sex tape. “my publicist would say to me, ‘you’re not getting naked. i have to be there,’ ” she says. i suggest that if your publicist keeps warning you not to get naked, she must know you’re always in danger of getting naked. is there an age limit for the naked photo shoot? “yes,” she says. “i’m like, i’m going to tone it down. but then i’m like, wait, i can’t be doing it in  years, so — i might as well. i don’t know what the age cutoff is.” we know everything about kim kardashian west. she has shown us everything. talked about everything. many times. in different languages. kim has talked about basketball, and baby poop, and having no idea where pickles come from, and the texture of cardboard, and kanye, and caitlyn jenner , and her sister’s boyfriend’s drug problems. recently, on her show, we even watched her share the story of how difficult her pregnancy and birthing process was and how she’s looking at some alternatives to carrying her next kid herself. have you ever considered, besides the solipsism, the bravery in that? you know the unflinching way she takes off her top in front of a camera? or wears a $ billion dress? that’s how unflinchingly she talks about the fragility of her own human body. it’s feminist. it’s a psa. here, in this glass-enclosed beveled luxury maze, while wealthy french businessmen finish eating their $ toast, i ask if she’s thought about a third child. and she retains this unblinking steady-state feline eye contact and a sense of self-assurance that could freeze water while she says, “i would like to, but i’ve had lots and lots of complications. i had preeclampsia. and then i also had something called placenta accreta. we’ve explored surrogacy. we’re thinking about it.” i get the vibe from her that, just as she has the crushing instincts necessary to lay waste to our culture and create an america in her image (or is it that she’s created america’s image?), she also has the instinct to preserve the humanity of her family. “we don’t do gifts,” she says when i ask her if she worries about her kids growing up with too much. “ talk about it all the time, about not getting too much and trying to be as grounded and well rounded as possible.” she holds herself to the same standard. “i don’t like presents anymore,” she says. “we just did absolutely nothing . we spent two days in santa barbara, and we slept.” then she remembers: “you know what? i think we went to ihop. that’s what we did.” and then she tells me this story. a motherhood story. it’s about the time last year, in paris, when she was held at gunpoint and bound and robbed in a hotel by masked gunmen. well, she tells me, she’d been scared to go on that trip. she was afraid of a terrorist attack. she’d never experienced anxiety like that before. she even went to a therapist about it. and north, sensing her mother’s anxiety, wanted to reassure her. “she gave me a little plastic treasure box, and she put her little jewels in it — like fake little plastic jewels — and she was like, ‘mommy, this will keep you safe when you go to paris.’ ” it is something that, despite all the jewels and calabasas houses and red carpet gowns and original basquiats and rolls-royces and pairs of yeezy boots she has, penetrates down into the depths of kim kardashian west’s humanity, which, at least after spending a few hours with her, i believe is very much there. “to have something really sweet like that is more important to me than all the jewelry,” she says. she tells me she takes it everywhere with her. around us, european businessmen sign their checks, step into hushed elevators and are whisked to meetings with continental vampires. kim k. says she’s going to see what north is up to. i’m trying to figure out what’s weird about seeing her in person, at this phase of her life. and i think it’s that she wears her crown lightly. i guess it’s that she’s chill. which doesn’t seem like the one word you’d use for kim k. i guess it’s that she’s really a mom now. she is a beautiful, worldly -year-old woman drinking the last of a cup of english breakfast tea before going out into the world to see to her empire, with her four-year-old child at her side, bearing witness to the domination but never expecting, you know, presents.",1

398,"Sorry, Paris Hilton Never Actually Ordered Kim K Around On 'The Simple Life'","the internet loves to remind itself of kim kardashian's relatively humble beginnings. that is, before she became the world's most famous reality star, she spent her days toiling as an assistant to then-bff paris hilton. what's more, the internet loves to relive a few moments of hilton being particularly unkind to kardashian as she allegedly orders her around. those moments were forever captured on camera for episodes of ""the simple life"" back in the mid-. screengrabs from these episodes have become very popular, but there's just one problem -- the captions are completely fake and your favorite kim kardashian meme is a fraud. here's the conversation that actually took place on the episode: yep, that was a scene about giving a dog a pregnancy test. but moving on, this gif with a caption of hilton telling kardashian to organize her closet is again also  percent fake. and while it may be fake, it may actually be better than the real conversation that was had in paris' closet that day: paris: i love this closet, it's so good. kim: what's going on with this? paris: that's my 'if i ever go to india' outfit. kim: really? paris: yes. kim: are you planning on going? paris: yes, but don't you have to, like, cover up everything? kim: you're not allowed to show any of your hair. it's like a law. paris: are you allowed to have blond hair? if you travel there do you really have to do this? kim: i think so, or you'll get like shot or something. paris: that's hot. it's difficult to pinpoint exactly where these screengrabs with fake captions originated, but multiple news outlets just assumed they were real, and the myth of hilton as a demanding boss who desperately needed her closet organized only continued to grow. however, after learning what hilton and kardashian were really discussing at the time, the two might now be wishing the hotel heiress was actually ordering the future reality star to clean her closet. so, if you want these memes to live on, use the right captions:",1

402,Chris Pratt and Anna Faris Are Definitely Raising a Theater Kid,"chris pratt and anna faris’s four-year-old son, jack, is growing up in what is, essentially, an immersive-theater class. when pratt spoke to ellen degeneres on her talk show friday, he said that he and faris, both professional actors, take parenting, specifically story time, very seriously. “we’re strangely competitive with each other when it comes to entertaining him and getting into the characters,” he said, before recounting a recent bedtime-story moment: “we were reading this book, and i’ll start affecting a little accent for the character, and then she’s like, ‘oh,’ and she starts gesticulating and laughing.” pratt said that jack seemed to pay no interest to his parents’ competing dramatics. but when some version of method acting is happening in your bedroom every night, it’s pretty difficult not to pick up on it. it helps, too, when your parents trick you in to making an everyday occurrence something out of lee strasberg’s lesson plan. when jack was just three, faris told conan o’brien that she was teaching her toddler to have big, stage-worthy, emotional reactions to everyday events. jack seems to come by some very valuable talents naturally, though. in a  interview with ellen, pratt told the talk-show host that he often comes to his young son for sound advice. he shared a story of how jack picked up on tension at a family holiday gathering. “he says amazing things, profound things,” pratt said. “i was sitting down and i said, ‘you know, jack, there's a lot of people here, and it’s very loud, and people are gonna be having a lot of fun. and there might even be some tension.’ and he just said, ‘it’s family.’ i almost started crying. i was like, ‘thank you, son; you’re right.’ he’s like my therapist.” jack is clearly already a perceptive kid—another essential trait for a successful career in theater. combine that with his parents’ affinity for inundating him with classic hollywood films, and his acting career will be blossoming before we know it.",1

six kids, and the trauma of her split from brad pitt—and there’s the angelina jolie whose latest movie, a groundbreaking netflix original about cambodia’s genocide, is also a thank-you to the nation that transformed her. at her new l.a. mansion, jolie reveals the tension between the two angelinas and the reason her life will never be normal. like most things involving angelina jolie, stepping foot into her house is an experience so heightened one wonders if it’s for real or the product of careful orchestration. the large gates to her recently purchased los feliz house—an ,-square-foot beaux-arts mansion once owned by the epic filmmaker cecil b. demille—slowly swing open, revealing rolling lawns, lush trees at the perimeter. no one’s there, and all is quiet except for the delicate sound of fountains, arched in a row over a swimming pool. a number of doors to the house are open, as if posing some riddle from a fairy tale—which one to enter? inside, the vibe is airy and calm: all open windows and cross-breezes, creamy-white unlit candles, soft creamy-white furnishings. finally she emerges from the other side of the house and glides across the room in a creamy-white, floor-length caftan. her hair is down, her feet bare, only a touch of makeup, her skin luminous. she smiles widely—a beneficent, ethereal wood nymph. but as soon as she starts speaking, you realize that your preconceived notions about jolie aren’t quite right. she’s not a celestial goddess. she’s not the high-and-mighty do-gooder. she’s not the intense control freak—or at least not obviously so. she comes across, rather, as normal-person friendly and practical, even chitchatty. she explains the deal with the big empty mansion. she moved into this space just four days ago with her six kids. it wasn’t for the prestigious history or the architecture. she needed a good place fast, somewhere secluded, with a lot of rooms; this one, which was listed for around $ million, has six bedrooms and  bathrooms. following her september  filing for divorce from brad pitt, she and her children spent nine months in a rental, basically living out of suitcases. and so she hasn’t really unpacked, barely knows her way around the place, has never had a real visitor, and isn’t sure where the best spot is to sit and talk. with that in question, she roams from room to room—the fabulous kitchen, worthy of a nancy meyers movie, charming gray library with a library ladder (her favorite room in the house), the generous landing at the foot of a sweeping staircase, anchored by a round table with a bouquet of white flowers. she finally settles on the living room, which a set-decorator friend furnished on the fly, with two creamy-white sofas and some big throw pillows. she looks at them curiously. “i didn’t even know i needed ‘throw pillows.’ ” decorating, house stuff, “that was always brad’s thing.” on cue, as if taunting her, jolie’s large rottweiler, dusty, soaking from a trip to the pool, jumps onto the sofa, soiling it. she sighs, amused, half tries to wipe it off with her bare hand, then gives up and sits somewhere else. photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott. styled by jessica diehl. life in her household is apparently like this—messy, relaxed, normal. the kids are polite but not phony polite. zahara, , whom jolie describes as “the rock” of the family, comes downstairs. “zaz!” jolie cries, midsentence. they discuss the whereabouts of everyone else. zahara hugs the wet dog. jolie laughs and tells her daughter about the swim dusty just took. we move to the kitchen, where jolie fixes herself a cup of tea. vivienne, , comes in with a friend, having just been at a sleepover. she’s wearing a jean backpack covered with pins. jolie envelops her in her arms. i ask the girl if she’s called “viv” or “vivienne.” “either one!” she says with a smile. she dumps her stuff on the counter and goes out to play with her friend. jolie picks up a small piece of a blanket, shredded to death, and explains, laughing, “she has  blankets. she is very into her blanket, and she gets very mad if you wash her blanket. she actually said to me the other day, ‘mom, i can taste my blanket.’ ‘that, honey, is a sign that it really, really needs to be washed.’ ” jolie tidies up vivienne’s things and promptly spills her entire mug of tea all over the counter. we step outside and there’s shiloh, , and knox, , hanging out. shiloh, who likes to dress like a boy, is wearing a camouflage jacket, long shorts, and heavy black sneakers, despite the blazing heat. knox immediately wants to know when jolie’s going to put up the waterslide. “how about a ‘hello, mom’?” she says, with a hug, sounding like just about every other loving, exasperated mother in america. so far, there’s only one piece of personal artwork up—a black-and-white photograph on the mantelpiece of the six children, smiling and holding their various pets—dogs, reptiles, and rodents. jolie and pitt, who’d been together for  years and appeared to be the most gloriously evolved couple in hollywood, split last september. she filed for divorce suddenly “for the health of the family,” according to her lawyer, and announced she was seeking sole custody of the children, three of whom are adopted (maddox, , pax, , and zahara), three of whom are biological (shiloh, vivienne, and knox). things had been rocky for some time, but the last straw was a dramatic trip on a private plane, where there was reportedly a physical and verbal altercation between pitt and maddox. when they touched down, jolie went home with the kids, effectively kicking him out. this was no “conscious uncoupling.” an anonymous phone call was made to authorities. the f.b.i. and the los angeles county department of children and family services began investigating pitt for child abuse. he was soon cleared and later said in an interview with gq style that he was smarting from the pain of his suddenly broken family and admitted he had a serious drinking problem. there were rumors he was having an affair with marion cotillard (denied by both pitt and cotillard). jolie got the early jump p.r.-wise. but pitt won hearts and minds with the mea culpa in gq style. the two are still negotiating the terms of their divorce. as for jolie, a life already bursting at the seams—with acting, directing, humanitarian work, parenting six kids, and guest-lecturing on women’s rights at the london school of economics—just got exponentially bigger and more complicated, because she’s now doing it alone. there’s the chaos surrounding the practical day-to-day—playdates, doctors’ appointments, packing and unpacking, and organizing mealtimes. and there’s the deeper, emotional chaos. “it’s just been the hardest time, and we’re just kind of coming up for air.  is a big jump forward for us, and we’re all trying to do our best to heal our family.” as it happens, the personal trauma has coincided with her most personal film yet. jolie has directed a moving, large-scale adaptation of first they killed my father, loung ung’s  memoir of the khmer rouge genocide, in which ung’s parents and two of her siblings perished, along with an estimated two million other cambodians, a quarter of the country’s population. shot entirely in cambodia, and in the khmer language, the film, a netflix original, is the largest production the country has witnessed since the war, and according to the reports of several cambodians who’ve seen it, it’s one of the most revelatory pieces of art about that chapter in the country’s history, a history that’s still difficult for cambodians to discuss. but if cambodians consider the film to be something of a gift, then it’s surely a thank-you gift. for jolie, cambodia is where she started her family, and it’s where she made a cathartic personal transformation, becoming the woman she is today. recall, if you can, the angelina of the late , the era of angie peak crazy. specializing in dark volatile characters that seemed extensions of her wild-child restless self, jolie won three golden globes for her roles in television movies and a best- supporting-actress oscar for her portrayal of a young woman with apparent borderline personality disorder in girl, interrupted. she talked freely about having dabbled in heroin and self-cutting, and her love of knives. she and new husband billy bob thornton wore each other’s dried blood in pendants around their necks, and publicly bragged about their wild sex. at the  oscar ceremony, she talked provocatively about being “so in love . . . right now” with her brother, james, and kissed him with unsettling intimacy. to be sure, jolie had legitimate pain in her early life—her father, actor jon voight, had been unfaithful to her mother, marcheline bertrand, and the two split up early on. but it was first world pain. being hollywood’s newest “it girl” landed jolie the title role in lara croft: tomb raider, based on a popular video game. as it happened, the movie, an example of hollywood’s most vacuous, commercial, shoot-’em-up instincts, was filmed on location in cambodia. there, jolie, who’d grown up in privileged bubbles in los angeles and new york, witnessed what real suffering looked like: poverty, the loss of limbs from land mines, a generation of relatives wiped out. in this world there was no room for free-floating malaise or self-indulgent antics. and in spite of their profound trials, “i found a people who were so kind and warm and open, and, yes, very complex,” recalls jolie. “you drive around here you can see a lot of people with many things, but not often expressing happiness. you go there, and you see the families come out with their blanket and their picnic to watch a sunset.” photographs by mert alas and marcus piggott. styled by jessica diehl. she suddenly became curious about the world—starting with the country she was in. one day in siem reap, cambodia, she picked up a book that was being sold on the side of the road for $: ung’s memoir. it was among the factors that inspired jolie to find a greater purpose. in , equipping herself with as much knowledge as she could, she contacted the united nations and eventually became a goodwill ambassador for the high commissioner for refugees. on one of her first u.n. missions, in , she returned to cambodia to meet up with ngo workers who were dealing with land-mine issues. among them was ung, the author of that transformative book, who had moved to america since the war but had spent her adult years working on cambodia’s troubles. she had never seen an angelina jolie movie, but jolie certainly didn’t seem like anyone’s vision of a movie star. “she was just a really cool human being,” recalls ung. “and she didn’t mind getting dirty.” on her relationship with brad pitt: “we care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.” she and jolie clicked and made a plan to travel together to a land-mine-filled part of cambodia where ung hadn’t been since the war. thus began a sequence that sounds as though it must have been written for a movie—but it wasn’t. they met up with a bunch of de-miners, took off on mo-peds, with only a flashlight and some extra toilet paper as supplies, when a monsoon started. soaked, they went to bed in hammocks. before going to sleep, jolie realized she already trusted ung enough to ask her about something personal, something big she’d been thinking about—adopting a cambodian orphan. “i asked her as a cambodian orphan if she would be offended for somebody like me, an outsider, , or if that would be a nice thing,” recalls jolie. ung was wholeheartedly supportive. “angie was maternal to everybody around her, not just children, but adults included. i wanted her to adopt me,” says ung. “i was orphaned when i was eight years old, and so i think, when you’ve gone through experiences like that, there’s always a part of you that craves to have full parent figures in your life.” jolie says that ung’s enthusiasm for the idea of her adopting was a deciding factor. had she responded differently, explains jolie, “it might have changed my decision. it might have made it very hard for me.” ung has been in jolie’s life ever since and is now one of her few close friends. jolie immediately set the adoption process in motion. a couple of months later, she visited an orphanage in the provincial town of battambang, having promised herself that she’d go only to one, that she wasn’t going to shop around. but jolie felt uneasy as she wandered the rooms, meeting the children. “i didn’t feel a connection with any of them,” she recalls. photographs by mert alas and marcus piggott. styled by jessica diehl. photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott. styled by jessica diehl. “they then said, ‘there’s one more baby.’ ” baby maddox was lying in a box that was suspended from the ceiling. she looked at him. he looked at her. “i cried and cried,” she recalls. and thus began a -year project, in which jolie rebranded herself, expanding her world, her family, her career, and her image. she bought a house in cambodia and became a citizen. in , she started what became the maddox jolie-pitt foundation, focusing on cambodia’s environmental conservation, health, education, and infrastructure. she intensified her u.n. work, going on dozens of fact-finding missions, to such global hot spots as sierra leone, afghanistan, iraq, bosnia, and haiti. (she’s now been on more than  missions.) she split from thornton, who didn’t understand her newfound passion. she adopted her second child, zahara, from ethiopia. in  she met pitt, on the set of mr. & mrs. smith, when he was still married to jennifer aniston. for jolie, dating pitt—hollywood’s gorgeous, laid-back golden boy—catapulted her to another level of fame. though she has maintained that they didn’t become romantically involved until he and aniston had split, the couple wasted no time in exhibiting their romance for the pages of w, which did a -page spread of them playing house, with a pretend brood of five. aniston was devastated. for pitt, dating jolie meant doing it her way, at least at the outset. it marked the beginning of his own philanthropic life—in africa, haiti, and new orleans—and he formally adopted maddox and zahara. he persuaded jolie to have biological children. she gave birth to shiloh in , in namibia, then the twins, vivienne and knox, in . in between they adopted pax, then three, from vietnam. they bought more homes—in france, spain, new york, and new orleans. while pitt, as a producer and actor, churned out one prestige movie after another (moonlight, the tree of life, moneyball,  years a slave), jolie took a new chance with directing—with in the land of blood and honey, about bosnia, a project inspired by some of the u.n. work she’d done there. together, they appeared unstoppable, the most creatively alive citizens on the planet. nothing seemed beyond their abilities. they traipsed around the globe as a nomadic clan of eight, making art, doing good, and setting up home wherever they happened to be. they tied the knot in , mainly because the kids wanted them to. they had the means to take along tutors for the children wherever they went. but jolie’s idea of an education meant immersion in the real world, to bring an understanding of one’s “small part in the bigger picture.” for a time, it all worked beautifully. photographs by mert alas and marcus piggott. styled by jessica diehl. it was , and jolie had recently finished in the land of blood and honey. she wanted her next project to be just as meaningful, and ung’s story had at this point been with her for a decade. by the time they had a completed draft, the chance for jolie to direct unbroken, based on the best-selling book by laura hillenbrand, had come along, and they put the script aside. after that, maddox, who knew “auntie” loung’s story, brought it up. “he was the one who said, ‘it’s time to do it,’ ” says jolie. she knew that maddox would be deeply involved in the production, that he’d be “standing there watching horrors that his countrymen did to each other.  he had to be ready.” jolie and ung dived back in. credited on the film as an executive producer, maddox read draft after draft, giving comments. jolie took it to netflix, where chief creative officer ted sarandos signed on without hesitation. “in the room, she created a visual experience of what this film could be,” recalls sarandos. “the film is in many ways about the death of beauty, about the way the khmer rouge had killed all things beautiful, color itself, which becomes part of the joy of life. . . . that’s what hooked me more than anything.” despite jolie’s cambodian ties, she felt she needed a cambodian filmmaker to help shepherd the project. so she reached out to rithy panh, one of the most famous filmmakers in cambodia, who had lost family members to the genocide and had chronicled the khmer rouge in several documentaries, including the missing picture, which was nominated for the best-foreign-language-film academy award in . she and panh agreed that the only way this film could be made was if cambodia wanted it to be—not a foregone conclusion, given that cambodians are still somewhat reticent about their painful history. (the killing fields, roland joffé’s  film about the khmer rouge, had to be filmed in thailand and elsewhere.) the war tribunals, which were set in motion in  and are ongoing, have helped open up the topic. still, jolie was trepidatious and approached the country’s culture ministers gingerly, explaining that they were telling not just ung’s story but also the story of a people. jolie’s cambodian track record made the difference, says ung. “in a country like cambodia, respect is very much elevated—respect for each other, respect for the culture, respect for the history, respect for the elders. angie walks in cambodia with this respect.” cambodia went all in—closing off battambang for days, giving the filmmakers permits to land in remote zones, providing them with  officials from their actual army to play the khmer rouge army. “it’s not a poetic thing to say— was made by the country,” says jolie. between cast and crew, some , cambodians participated. to cast the children in the film, jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. in order to find their lead, to play young loung ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. the director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. “srey moch  was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,” jolie says. “when she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. all these different things came flooding back.” jolie then tears up. “when she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn’t have enough money for a nice funeral.” that authentic connection to pain was awakened in everyone involved, says jolie, making for a film set like nothing she’d ever seen. “there wasn’t a person who was working on the movie who didn’t have a personal connection. they weren’t coming to do a job. they were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family, and it was out of respect for them that they were going to re-create it . . . it completed something for them.” some had flashbacks and nightmares. for this reason, a therapist was on set every day. and then there were the odd bystanders who hadn’t been aware that a movie was being made, and were traumatized. in one scene, recalls jolie, “when the khmer rouge came over the bridge, we had a few people who really dropped to their knees and wailed. they were horrified to see them come back.” given the size and complexity of the production, a different hollywood director might have, consciously or not, muscled in and flexed her power in a way that might have seemed boorish. according to ung and panh, jolie knows cambodia so well she’s internalized the country’s character traits. at lunch, she waited in line like everyone else, recalls panh, and she never raised her voice. “here we don’t shout. we talk,” he says. in cambodia, yelling is not just disrespectful—it’s also considered a sign of weakness. photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott. styled by jessica diehl. many eyes were on maddox, who is as famous in cambodia as jolie. “it was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked,” says jolie, who wasn’t sure how he’d ultimately react to the experience. would he connect? would he want to flee? jolie was thrilled one morning during the shoot when she heard maddox say, “can i go sleep in my house with my friends?,” referring to their house in the jungle, which she had bought back in . “i hadn’t heard him refer to it that way. you can’t push it. you can’t say, ‘isn’t this great?’ you just have to kind of keep bringing them there, putting it in front of them . . . and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort.” she considers the endeavor to connect maddox to his homeland—as she does zahara to ethiopia and pax to vietnam—a family effort, not a solo one. with that in mind, while pitt was in the middle east working on war machine, the other five kids also went to cambodia and played a role, official or not, in their mother’s movie. pax did still photography. the other four were on set every day and became close playmates with the child actors. in february, the film premiered for an audience of , at the outdoor amphitheater near the temple complex of angkor wat. according to numerous reports, it was a screening filled with tears of recognition, remembrance, and catharsis. what moved jolie perhaps more than anything was that “the cambodian people had a big movie premiere. they saw a movie for which they made the sets.  their actors doing a great job, their country looking beautiful even through all the horrors.” alas, while she was making film history for a country, her relationship with pitt was suffering. by the time first they killed my father was in postproduction, in the summer of , “things got bad,” says jolie. “i didn’t want to use that word. . . . things became ‘difficult.’ ” there has been hollywood talk that their lifestyle had taken its toll on pitt, and that he was craving a more stable, normal life for the whole family. when i bring this question up to her, it’s the one moment when jolie becomes a bit defensive. “ was not in any way a negative,” she says quickly, adamantly. “that was not the problem. that is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children . . . they’re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. i’m very proud of them.” jolie has indicated that, for the sake of the kids, she doesn’t want to talk about the breakup. and yet it seems she wants to get her point across, which calls for a careful choice of words, something of a high-wire act. “they’ve been very brave. they were very brave.” “in times they needed to be.” other statements are similarly cryptic. “we’re all just healing from the events that led to the filing . . . they’re not healing from divorce. they’re healing from some . . . from life, from things in life.” i mention pitt’s mea culpa in gq style. did it surprise her? “no,” she replies, looking unmoved. i refer to tabloid reports that suggest their communication has improved, and ask if that’s true. there’s a long pause. she looks down, formulates an answer. “we care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.” there’s anger and pain right there beneath the surface. but she’s trying to keep the emotions at bay. “i was very worried about my mother, growing up—a lot. i do not want my children to be worried about me. i think it’s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. they need to know that everything’s going to be all right even when you’re not sure it is.” photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott. styled by jessica diehl. her protectiveness over the kids has become all that more fierce due to her recent brushes with the specter of ovarian cancer; the disease took her mother’s life when she was just , as well as those of other family members. in a  new york times op-ed column, jolie chronicled her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after she learned she had the  gene. two years later, while working in the editing room on by the sea, she got a call from the doctor saying that he was concerned about certain levels in her blood work that potentially suggested cancer. “ten minutes later, the room’s spinning, and you just think, how . . . ?” she kept the news from the kids, did further tests, and waited a few agonizing days. when she finally learned she didn’t have cancer, “i dropped to my knees.” she made an appointment to get her ovaries taken out. “i went into the actual surgery happy as they come. i was skipping. because at that point it was just preventative.” she instantly went into menopause. last year, in addition to hypertension, jolie developed bell’s palsy, a result of damage to facial nerves, causing one side of her face to droop. “sometimes women in families put themselves last,” she says, “until it manifests itself in their own health.” jolie credits acupuncture for her full recovery from the condition. lately, her skin has become drier, she reports, and she has extra gray hairs. she quips, “i can’t tell if it’s menopause or if it’s just been the year i’ve had.” the idea that she could still be anyone’s idea of a sex symbol is laughable to her. but she says, “i actually feel more of a woman because i feel like i’m being smart about my choices, and i’m putting my family first, and i’m in charge of my life and my health. i think that’s what makes a woman complete.” photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott. styled by jessica diehl. tomorrow, jolie and the kids are headed to africa. they’re visiting namibia, where shiloh was born, and kenya, where jolie will be checking in with a project connected to the preventing sexual violence initiative, an organization she co-founded with british former foreign secretary william hague. specifically, members of the british military and peacekeepers will be receiving training in how to protect women from sexual violence in crisis zones. it’s not the obvious dream itinerary for a kid, and jolie admits that she’s started to get a little pushback with the older ones. “i’m conscious that the boys are teenage boys, and maybe they’d rather be watching tv with their friends, and they’ve been to africa, and they may not be as excited as the little ones. but they don’t really challenge me. they just kind of sit on the edge of my bed and say, ‘what are we going to do there?’ ” she assured them that she’d planned fun activities for them, like sandboarding. in any case, “they know that it’s important, and they know that mom thinks that it’s going to be important when they’re older.” she knows it sounds a little strange, but jolie can’t help who she is. “i never woke up and thought, i really want to live a bold life. i just can’t do the other. it’s the same as i can’t make a casserole. i cannot sit still.” for all her earlier talk about being interested in keeping house, now, as the conversation turns to africa, she’s champing at the bit, desperate to flee. “i’ve been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories. and i’m getting better at all three. but now i need to get my boots on and go hang, take a trip.” she believes that her personal will is infectious. the other day she made some joke to knox along the lines of “pretend to be normal.” “he said, ‘who wants to be normal? we’re not normal. let’s never be normal.’ thank you—yes! we’re not normal. let’s embrace being not normal!” photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott. styled by jessica diehl. to read vanity fair’s response to angelina jolie’s comments related to the september cover story, click here. sign up for essential industry and award news from hollywood.",1

""by the end of that evening, kanye was inviting harry to come into the studio to lay down some tracks. simon freaked when he heard that!"" a source said. rex features but why is simon so fuming, aside from the fact harry will fuel one direction split rumours with his antics? it's kris jenner (who asked harry to be on keeping up with the kardashians), that's got the high-trousered one in a grump: ""simon knows how controlling and manipulative kris is because he had dealings with her when khloe kardashian co-hosted the u.s. x factor for one season."" ""he's really worried about losing control of harry. he knows his lead singer's been thinking about a solo career, so the last thing he needs is the kardashians and kanye digging their claws into the one direction star and trying to separate him from the rest of the band - not to mention simon's record label!"" whilst we're sure harry can stand up for himself when it comes to kris jenner, we're more intrigued by the idea of a hazza/yeezus duet - what would that sound like?! on thursday  january, we wrote... those keeping tabs on all things kardashian will know that little sisters kendall and kylie appeared on us talk show host chelsea handler's show chelsea lately last night - and naturally, the ""h"" question was directed at kendall. when asked if she was dating harry styles, kendall remained coy as ever, trying to bat away the question. chelsea went straight in for the kill, asking: ""are you not public about your love lives?"" ""no, we don't talk about it,"" the girls responded. ""so you're single (signalling to kylie) and you're not dating harry styles (signalling to kendall), is that his name?,"" chelsea continued. kendall tried to avoid the question by looking flustered and giggling - refusing to either confirm or deny the claims as chelsea joked about meeting the  hunk to kendall, saying ""i don't know if you know him"". the pair also talked about kris jenner and bruce's recent divorce, with kendall telling the e! show host: ""i think we're doing fine...it sucks not having a dad living with you but i talk to him everyday."" watch the clip of the girls below: on  january , we wrote... it has been reported that the producers of keeping up with the kardashians are eager to get one direction's harry styles on the show. duh! of course they do - it's harry-blimming-styles. rex features the trouble is, harry ain't so keen, and has reportedly asked his rumoured new girlfriend kendall jenner not to film any scenes with or about him.

""casually hanging out with kendall jenner and harry styles. #dying.""  however it seems allie didn't expect the backlash from  as she took to twitter to defend the image, """"lol now i have  year olds telling me that i was paid to make this a publicity stunt. yep, you caught me hahahah,"" she wrote. harry and kendall have been spotted together on numerous occasions, first stepping out for dinner in november. yet the pair have been keen to deny rumours that they are an item with kendal telling e!that they ""are just friends,"" and harry telling piers morgan that they are not dating and just went out for dinner. on  december , we wrote... another day, another picture emerging that suggests this harry styles/kendall jenner thing could be for real. rex features dressed in a plaid shirt, blazer and jeans (after his keith richards-inspired headband and crucifix earring get-up on the x factor), styles was snapped arriving at kendall's london hotel in the early hours of sunday morning, after flying in from france where the band appeared at the nrj awards. the pair have been romantically linked ever since they were seen leaving a restaurant together in hollywood a month ago. since then, they've been seen leaving a nyc hotel together and on a few restaurant dates, and they've followed each other on instagram - which means they're practically married in celeb-ville. kendall took to instagram to document her time in london - including this rather pretty picture of big ben: kendall and harry have both been coy when asked about the relationship, insisting they are nothing more than friends. question is, how many dinner dates/hotel visits will we hear about until 'kenry' make their romance official? on tuesday,  december, we wrote... more details have emerged regarding that harry/kendall date the one direction star and budding model supposedly went on over the weekend. splash news according to us weekly, harry took kendall to a gay bar in nyc, hell's kitchen's therapy, for a special themed-night entitled ""gays gone wild"". the source added that harry is a regular at said haunt, and although the pair didn't hit the dancefloor, he left ""holding hands"" with kendall when the one direction hit what makes you beautiful came on - for fear of the pair being recognised. earlier the same day, 'kenry' caused a frenzy outside of nyc's gansevoort hotel when they were pictured leaving together. with harry (who was in town for his performance on snl) dressed in a peacoat and bandana, and kendall in a crop top, jeans and military jacket, the pair were swamped by fans as they left the hotel to get breakfast. they have reportedly stayed in touch ever since the american music awards, with a source telling e! news: ""i've never seen kendall happier and more fan friendly...they came off the elevator holding hands and then she stood and watched while he posed with fans."" although both have vaguely denied the dating rumours (kendall simply said ""he's cool, yeah, he's cool... you go out with one person, you're automatically dating them"", whilst harry told piers morgan ""dunno"" when asked to confirm their relationship status), this picture will no doubt send the rumour mill into a frenzy. on monday  november, we wrote... those harry styles and kendall jenner rumours? probably not true, if both the parties involved are to be believed. akm-gsi obviously the internet got a *little* carried away when the two were snapped leaving a dinner date together last week (because having dinner together = married in celeb-land), and both kendall and harry denied the dating rumours (if a little coyly) over the weekend. at the amas, kendall was asked by the e!'s giuliana rancic on the red carpet if she was indeed dating harry. her response? ""we're friends. he's cool, yeah, he's cool... you go out with one person, you're automatically dating them."" meanwhile, when quizzed on a possible romance by tv interviewer piers morgan, harry said:""i mean, we went out for dinner, but no, i guess."" and when asked if a romance could be in the pipeline after the one dinner date, styles simply replied ""dunno"". so not exactly a complete denial - but not a glowing declaration of love either. stay tuned to see if 'kenry' (yep, that's what people are calling them) really is on the cards. on thursday  november, we wrote... has the world imploded, or did we actually just see this picture of harry styles and kendall jenner? the one direction star and the kardashian sister were spotted leaving craig's restaurant together in hollywood last night after apparently enjoying a dinner date. keen to keep the rendez-vous under wraps, the pair left out of a private backdoor exit. they were then seen driving away together in styles' range rover. the pair met at the x factor usa studios, where one direction recorded their performance for the show this evening (or so says unreality tv). it may be a little premature to assume that these two are officially an item, but the mail online have already christened the pair kenry (the new kimye, y'all), so we're kind of hoping we're set to see a trans-atlantic teen power-couple confirm their romance in the coming weeks.",1

427,Kendall Jenner cries over Pepsi ad backlash in ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ premiere,"remember pepsi’s tone-deaf kendall jenner commercial back in april? the one that made people furious, because it appropriated images from black lives matter protests to sell soda? pepsi quickly pulled the ad after intense criticism — and in the six months since the controversy, kendall hasn’t publicly responded. that’s because she saved it all for the  season premiere of e!’s “keeping up with the kardashians,” which aired sunday night. the kardashian family has said that kendall was very upset over the backlash, and the premiere confirmed that, yes, the -year-old supermodel was mortified. although the episode ended with kendall sobbing (“obviously, if i knew that this was going to be the outcome, i would have never done something like this”), it was a slow build to her breakdown. in fact, the word “pepsi” never came up during the entire hour. it all started as kendall called her sisters kourtney and khloe kardashian. “are you okay?” kourtney said when she answered the phone. “you sound so sad.” “i talked to simon today,” kourtney said, likely referring to simon huck, a public relations guru and kim kardashian west’s close friend. “he was like, ‘the news lasts  hours.’ ” cut to an on-camera interview with khloe, who explained to the audience: “kendall did a commercial and basically caused a huge controversy. it sucks, because kendall’s been taking the blame for it all. kendall tries really hard to be socially conscious and aware of the jobs that she takes and to really think about how things affect other people, so it weighs really heavy on her heart.” producers showed some critical tweets about the commercial, such as, “so many adults had to f‑‑‑ up in so many unique and equally tone deaf ways to make this awful ad, it’s honestly breathtaking.” kourtney assured kendall that she spoke to family friend russell simmons, who said that kendall “can turn this into a positive.” this is never further explained. after they hung up, kourtney told khloe that it sounded like kendall was crying. later, kendall explained why she filmed the commercial in the first place — when she got the offer, she was thrilled to join the list of celebrities who have done pepsi ads, from michael jackson to beyoncé to britney spears. “i trusted everyone. i trusted the teams,” she told the camera. “but after i saw the reaction and i read what people had to say about it, i most definitely saw what went wrong. i was so stuck, and i really didn’t know what to do, that i completely shut down.” the following scene showed kendall sitting forlornly in her gigantic walk-in closet, talking to kim on the phone. the new issue? her father, caitlyn jenner, was going on a book tour. kendall was worried that caitlyn might say something about the commercial that would make things worse. “she just tends to, like, say a lot, and i just would rather everyone just not say anything,” kendall said. “i mean, god bless her for trying.” “i know. but caitlyn is known for saying all the wrong things,” kim said. she promised to call caitlyn and let her know it was a very sensitive subject. so kim called caitlyn and told her not to answer questions about the pepsi ad — and if she felt compelled, just say something along the lines of, “kendall had the best intentions with this being something, like, peaceful, and she totally gets everyone’s point of view now. it was not appropriate, and she’s so sorry.” naturally, caitlyn did not follow that advice, and instead talked about the commercial in a radio interview and said kendall knew all about the ad’s script beforehand and thought it was fine. the episode ended as kendall went to talk to kim, about three weeks after the commercial was pulled. she was upset about caitlyn, and even more about the whole situation. “i just feel really, really bad. like, i feel really bad that anyone was ever offended. i feel really bad that this was taken such a wrong way,” kendall said. “i genuinely feel like s‑‑‑, and i have no idea how i’m going to bounce back from it.” “this is the first time you’ve had a scandal,” kim gently reminded her. “this is your first real experience with something like this.” “the text messages i would get from people, they’d be like, ‘it’s going to be fine, like, you know everything blows over in, like, a week’s time’ or whatever. and i’m just like, ‘okay, but it’s been, like, three weeks and it’s not going anywhere,’ ” kendall said. “yeah, but it will,” kim assured her. “this is just going to be the biggest lesson learned for you.” “i really don’t even know what to do at this point. it’s really depressing, and it bothers me every single day,” kendall said. “you’re the last person to want to hurt someone or be insensitive, but it’s, like, it really sucks. i think the only thing you can really do is just be real and honest, because you can’t ignore it. like, you can’t,” kim said. “it should affect you in a way where you grow from it, and you’re like, “okay, i’m a better person from it.’ . . . i just wish that you could see that there’s light at the end of the tunnel.” despite kim’s words of wisdom, kendall still broke down crying to the camera. “i would never purposely hurt someone, ever,” kendall said tearfully. “you don’t know when you’re in the moment, and, like, it was the most —” she grappled for the right words. “i just felt so f‑‑‑ing stupid. the fact that i would offend other people or hurt other people was definitely not the intent. and that’s what got me the most, is that i would have ever made anyone else upset.” after pepsi pulled the ad, the company apologized for putting kendall jenner in an awkward position. last week, pepsi chief executive indra nooyi told fortune that she didn’t initially see the ad’s final scene that caused so much “consternation,” in which jenner handed a cop a can of pepsi. “this has pained me a lot because this company is known for diversity, and the fact that everybody who produced the commercial and approved the commercial did not link it to black lives matter made me scratch my head. i had not seen that scene,” nooyi said. “and i take everything personally. the minute i saw people upset, i pulled it. and you know what, it’s not worth it. there were people on both sides, but at the end of the day, our goal is not to offend anybody.” ‘clearly we missed the mark’: pepsi pulls kendall jenner ad and apologizes the kardashians aren’t thrilled with caitlyn jenner’s new book",1
428,Fans think Taylor Swift and Drake might be dating - here's all the evidence,"fans think taylor swift and drake are dating. they're probably just making music together. the truth can be a slippery thing. let's get this out of the way right now: taylor swift and drake are probably not dating. but according to some people, they are - and if true, it could be huge news in the music business. though there's little evidence to support the theory that drake and taylor are an item, people online have been conjecturing wildly. here's what we know. at the stroke of midnight, on the evening of october , drake turned  years old. he hosted a big birthday party and, as celebrities do, had a bunch of other celebrities and hanger-ons there. ""taylor arrived with some friends and looked to be having fun,"" an anonymous source told e!. ""after dinner there was lots of dancing. at one point drake and taylor were seen near the dj together talking, his arm over her shoulder for a minute like a real friend moment. it looked like they were talking about something deep."" at some point during the evening, ""everyone sang happy birthday to drake,"" according to e!. swift was presumably among the singers. drake also introduced swift to his mom, according to tmz. swift and drake posed for a few photos, and that's the extent of their known contact that night. so, are they dating? twitter users sure shipped them. ""rihanna how do you feel about drake and taylor swift dating?"" taylor releases her version of lemonade 'pumpkin spice' - danny  october ,  so drake and taylor swift are dating predictions: drake cheats on taylor taylor releases her version of lemonade 'pumpkin spice' - danny  october ,  drake and taylor swift already have a hilarious picture together that rivals all the pictures of hiddleswift pic.twitter.com/ - anu  october ,  when sources are saying things are starting to heat up between drake and taylor swift but you ain't even know they were dating pic.twitter.com/ - orlando  october ,  can't wait for drake and taylor swift to break up and write albums dragging each other - comfortably smug  october ,  on november , as the dating rumors were flaring up, page six came out with another report that the two were making music together. e! news confirmed the report: for those surprised by the seemingly unlikely duo, our source reveals ""the music they have been working on is different,"" albeit ""very catchy."" the insider adds, ""they've both been having a great time in the studio."" that means they're spending a lot of time together. possibly alone. possibly not. so they could be working on music together, and they could be hooking up. who's to say? drake has an impish, winking relationship with his fans. on ""saturday night live,"" he once sang about how he's more than just a meme. so later in november, he posted a picture of himself and swift together with the caption ""is that velvet? "" a photo posted by champagnepapi  on nov ,  at : pdt on once again, a general freak out occurred. the coy flower emoji seemed especially designed to make people wonder what on earth was happening. the hip-hop artist released an ad where - in his self-aware persona - he sings along to swift's ""bad blood."" it's a reference to a commercial swift made a few months earlier, where she ran on a treadmill, and fell off it, while singing along to drake and future's ""jumpman."" and when drake posted his ad on instagram, he snuck in the hashtag ""#draylor."" maybe it's a hashtag for the ad, maybe it's a hashtag for the two as a couple. clearly, swift and drake are friendly enough to make referential meta-jokes about one another. the swift-drake relationship is less about actual evidence that they're dating and more about wish fulfillment and fun speculation. fans don't believe the couple are dating as much as they want to will their relationship into existence. but why does it hold so much appeal? for her part, swift recently ended a summer fling with tom hiddleston. that relationship was a strange fit. swift is one of the biggest celebrities in the world. hiddleston - though he is a fine actor, conventionally attractive, and still the best villain in the marvel cinematic universe - is simply not on her level. apart from star power, hiddleston, , always seemed so much older than swift, . for these reasons and more, hiddleswift always made for a slightly bizarre coupling to outsiders. meanwhile, drake has been in an on-again-off-again relationship with rihanna for years. it arguably culminated in august when drake professed his love for her on stage in the vmas. but right now, they're off again. a swift-drake relationship would distract the public from any image-altering breakups and reestablish both of them as the desirable, über talented a-listers they are. of course, this narrative could just be publicity for their new song together. even if swift and drake aren't in love, they're a match made in pr heaven.",1
429,Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Hit New York Fashion Week,"jamie foxxand katie holmes have hit the big apple. this unconfirmed pair has a knack for popping up in the same city around the same time and it happened again when the two actors were spotted separately throughout manhattan this week as the bi-annual fashion week comes to another close. while the logan lucky actress headed to fashion shows for lanyu and ralph lauren earlier in the week, the musician attended other events around town, including the sherri hill fashion show, in which his daughter walked on tuesday night, and the hand in hand celebrity benefit for hurricane relief. while the manhattan shutterflies haven't caught the two together, it's only been a week since a source confirmed the two stars spent labor day in malibu together, ""holding hands"" along the sand. ""they went in the water and were splashing around, flirting and getting close,"" the source added, describing the outing as a ""romantic date."" tmz also published photos of their holiday rendezvous. meanwhile, the two have yet to confirm their longtime speculated romantic link.

""it's easy and they are for sure very much in love."" rochlin/hand in hand/getty images; clint spaulding/wwd/rex/shutterstock though we can only purely speculate that the two may have crossed paths while in new york, foxx was focused on another special lady—his daughter, corinne bishop. the actor was a proud dad tuesday night as bishop strutted the catwalk in elegant evening couture at sherri hill. ""he's like my number one fan,"" she told e! news of her father backstage at the show. once she hit the runway, the star could be seen sitting front row with his phone glued on his daughter, capturing her every step. as he told reporters backstage, ""for any father with young kids, we hope that they find something that they want to do and they find something that makes them feel good about it.""",1
430,Stop Right Now! The Spice Girls Might Be Planning A Reunion,"there are certain things that people just shouldn't joke about. a potential spice girls reunion with all five members is one of them. earlier this morning, news broke that the most iconic girlband of all time may be reuniting in , sending chills down the spines of every  girl power advocate up and down the country. according to the independent, mel c has reportedly been working quietly with the band's former boss simon fuller over the past few months to bring victoria beckham, mel b, emma bunton and geri horner (née halliwell) back for the one-off special, with a compilation record expected to land next year. a source told the sun: 'the five of them have been locked in secret talks since the summer, and finally they are all on-board for a  reunion. 'as it stands, they will be working together on a series of projects, which will include an album and a tv special celebrating the spice girls - and getting victoria to agree has been a coup for everyone involved, given she has always been the person holding back on a reunion.' but alas, spice girls fans, we need to stay rational about this. put away the platform trainers and ask yourself, 'would victoria actually agree to this?' let us present an analysis... although many a source is reporting that scary, baby, sporty, ginger and posh are set to make a comeback next year, we mustn't forget the numerous times that beckham has staunchly opposed a spice reunion. it was only earlier this year that ex-posh spice turned fashion mogul told u.s. breakfast show the today show that 'there won't be a reunion because i think that when we performed at the olympics, it was so great, and that was us celebrating everything that we'd achieved'. she then went on to say: 'i still talk to all the other girls, we're still very close, but i think you need to know when it's time to actually say, ""that was great, we achieved a lot,"" and everybody moves on.' a new album doesn't sound much like moving on, does it? understandably, victoria now has a family and a thriving business in the fashion industry to look after and, in the past, has cited these commitments as her reasoning for not wanting to reunite with her bandmates. all hope is not lost, however, as, when asked about a potential spice girls reunion, mel c was previously quoted on the nightly show saying: 'i kind of feel like it's not really doing the band justice to go out as a four piece, whoever's missing it doesn't matter.' so, surely if there were to be some kind of reunion it must involve all five original members... right? dare we believe the rumours that all five have been in 'secret talks' over the summer and are on board? should we really raise our hopes that high? whatever the case, the spice girls will always 'viva forever' in our hearts.",1

443,What’s Kanye West’s Next Move?,"there’s something missing. can you feel it? a slight twinge in the universe, quick and subtle, but a definite sign that something in the world just shifted. ah, here’s what it is—kanye west just deleted his twitter and instagram accounts. the rapper apparently decided to abolish his social-media presence on friday, waving good-bye to all those followers and likes and faves. those tweets about wiz khalifa’s cool pants? gone. that “###hashtag all positive vibes” tweet? gone. those “i’m so lucky” tweets accompanied by nearly nude shots of his wife, kim kardashian west? banished to the nothingness hinterlands of deleted posts. so too are all those random insta photos of old margiela lookbooks. for what it’s worth, west was never much of an instagram power user anyway, deferring to his wife on that social platform (though he occasionally made strong post recommendations). his twitter account, however, was practically an extended part of his brain, a home for stream-of-consciousness thoughts that caused as much controversy as they did delight. so why did he delete it? and what does it all mean right now? well, this isn’t the first time west has waved good-bye to his social-media platforms. sometimes, it’s because the artist wants to garner a little bit of buzz for upcoming projects. back in , west deleted all of his tweets, leaving only one cryptic message up: “june eighteen.” that ended up being the release date for his upcoming album yeezus, which was famously inspired by a corbusier lamp and was released without an album cover or promotional singles. so what could it be this time around? west ended  on a rough personal note, hospitalized for exhaustion and sleep deprivation. he later kicked up controversy by meeting with donald trump at trump tower shortly after his election, tweeting about it, and then deleting those tweets. west, as all his fans know, has serious political aspirations, announcing his presidential dreams at, of all west-ian locations, the  mtv video music awards. nevertheless, west has been maintaining a low profile as of late and is probably putting his political dreams on the back burner for the moment. it’s more likely that he’s deleting his social accounts () to get attention, and/or () for an upcoming artistic project. the workaholic is constantly working on new music and new fashion for his yeezy season line and adidas collection. on friday, he and kardashian west launched thekidssupply, a high-priced children’s clothing collection. he recently released a high-end collection of religious-inspired gold jewelry. “i wanted to create something that represented timeless love,” he recently told vogue. the only thing missing from his endless release cycle is . . . new music. last year, shortly after releasing the life of pablo (a release cycle marked by controversial tweets), __west tweeted about a cryptic new music project titled turbo grafx , after the old gaming console. however, that project seems to have fallen to the wayside, as there have been new rumblings of a nasa-inspired project, though it was later debunked by fans. still, it’s impossible to believe he’s not working on something new. but maybe—just maybe—west is . . . merely enjoying being an incredibly rich celebrity? taking a much-needed break from the public eye? the fashion-obsessed star recently skipped the met gala, an event he’s frequented numerous times over the year as the chief ambassador of #vibes and shredded jeans. why did he skip it? he just wanted to stay home, according to his wife. “he’s been taking some time off and really loving that,” she told andré leon talley on the red carpet. o.k., we’ll consider that story . . . for now. but don’t expect west to stay off social media for too long.",1

470,Analysis | Kanye West and how hip-hop tackles mental health,"it's not totally clear what's going on with kanye west. the rapper, who was filmed delivering onstage rants during recent shows in california, on monday canceled the remaining  dates in his saint pablo tour. hours later, he was reportedly hospitalized for stress and exhaustion. west spent the night at ronald reagan ucla medical center for his own safety, the associated press reported. police, without confirming the patient as west, told ap that the officers arrived at a west hollywood home for a disturbance, and an ambulance took the patient to the hospital to be placed on a psychiatric hold. before his hospitalization, west's public breakdowns and stream-of-consciousness speeches have been the subject of jokes and disdain. but recent reports about west's well-being have reopened a conversation about mental health, fame and hip-hop. the genre has long been characterized by notions of hyper-masculinity that allow little room for vulnerability, and of black and brown men putting forward a tough, adversarial persona. but hip-hop has always had introspective moments (geto boys rapped ""my mind is playing tricks on me"" in ). in recent years, we've seen more artists opening up about their emotional and mental struggles in the public eye and on albums. eminem followed his  album ""relapse"" with one called ""recovery,"" after experiencing addiction and depression. dmx has rapped and spoken about suffering from bipolar disorder. in october, kid cudi publicly announced on his facebook page that he checked himself into rehabilitation for his ""depression and suicidal urges,"" writing ""anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as i can remember and i never leave the house because of it."" this followed angry tweets directed at drake and west. after it became public knowledge that kid cudi had checked into rehab, drake released a song with lyrics dissing the rapper and his mental well-being. and despite the backlash against drake online, the toronto rapper doubled down. but much of the response to kid cudi was positive. a hashtag, #yougoodman, gained momentum as a conversation around masculinity, race and mental health took place on social media. on monday, kid cudi posted a list of celebrities, artists and fans who actively supported him (including west). ""thank you for opening your hearts and extending your love and support during a troubling time,"" he wrote. kendrick lamar has also written and spoken about depression and the emotional tumult of being on a world tour while his best friends back home were gunned down. much of his album ""to pimp a butterfly"" centers on survivor's guilt.  his lyrics were used for a kaiser permanente ad about depression. after a  concert, lamar saw a woman crying and murmuring ""you saved my life."" she told him she was going to kill herself a year ago, but his music helped her through. pharoahe monch, a beloved independent artist, has been open about dealing with depression, which he has said in interviews was induced by a combination of medications he was taking following hospitalization for his asthma. ""at that time, it wasn't really like it was now, where you have people talking about issues readily in the public,"" he said in a  interview. ""years ago, it was just, 'yo, you bugging. just deal with it.'"" in another interview, he told msnbc host melissa harris-perry that it was important for his  album, ""ptsd,"" to include frank and vulnerable lyrics about his struggles and the stigma of depression within the black community. ""growing up in the community, you look at mental issues as, we're strong, and my parents were hard-working - it's something that's looked at as a weakness so you kind of push through it sometimes without even realizing what the issue might be."" in ""losing my mind,"" pharoahe monch raps, ""my family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health/it was more or less an issue for white families with wealth."" he continues: ""void, i defected, employed self annoyed/went independent, enjoyed stealth/now doctors prescribed sedatives and prozac."" west's lyrics, particularly on ""life of pablo,"" have caused alarm among some who speculate there's more to them than bombastic exaggeration. for instance, on ""fml,"" he raps about nothing being crazier than when ""he off his lexapro."" but west is not just a hip-hop artist; he is a megastar. aside from music, he works in the fashion industry, and is married to one of the most famous women in the world, one who has built her career off documenting every aspect of her life. west's tweets generate trending hashtags and breathless media coverage.  his public behavior over the years has fueled rumors among the public and garnered genuine concern from fans and those close to him. much of this began after his mother's  death. he has gone on twitter rants, given rambling interviews and stormed award-show stages - most famously in , when he interrupted taylor swift's mtv video music award acceptance speech, turning him into a pariah and punchline. rhymefest, who has co-written west tracks for years, announced in february that he had stopped collaborating with the chicago artist a month earlier after his work on ""life of pablo"" was complete. ""his mind and spirit isn't right,"" rhymefest tweeted. he also tweeted, ""i love my brother. i pray for his health not our entertainment."" last week, west brought a sacramento concert to a halt with an onstage speech that went after, among other things, jay z, beyoncé, hillary clinton, mtv and facebook. when the news of his hospitalization broke monday night, celebrities and artists immediately offered words of support. ""i want to extend a very special prayer to my big brother, kanye west,"" chance the rapper, a west collaborator, said in the middle of a performance on bbc radio . ""i want to just extend this prayer and extend this love from all the way in britain. we might come back early to come see this man."" producer  wonder tweeted, ""been knowing the brother upwards of  years. mental health is a serious thing, no matter what.""",1

478,Ben Affleck Has Reportedly Started Training For The Batman,"if you have been worried about ben affleck’s place in the dc extended universe, then you can breathe a sigh of relief. over the last few months, fans of the actor’s take on the gotham vigilante have grow increasingly worried about whether affleck would return to the role. a series of blips concerning batman’s impending standalone movie were enough to make the most confident of fans second-guess affleck’s longterm commitment to batfleck. in fact, some were even worried the actor would back out of the batman entirely after affleck stepped down as director. but, if one inside scoop has anything to say, then affleck is still down to reprise bruce wayne for the solo venture. earlier today, noted dc comics insider umberto gonzalez dropped some batman scoop in an episode of heroic insider. it was there the reporter said affleck has started a new training regiment to get him ready for the batman. “ben affleck, batman, i just got word that he just started training again for the role. you know how there was talk that he was gonna leave and he might leave the role? nah, bro. he’s working out. he’s getting back in shape,” gonzalez told fans. of course, there is no official confirmation about whether affleck’s new workout schedule adheres to such a promise. still, it seems more and more likely that affleck will return to the superhero role. excitement for justice league continues to mount ahead of its fall premiere this year, and the introduce of matt reeves to the batman has fans fired up as well. in a recent interview with daily news, the director admitted he’s been a batman fanboy for years, and reeves seems partial to affleck’s darker take on the character. “it’s a strange thing to be involved in the two franchises which were the two that i was connected to most as a child,” reeves said. “i just was obsessed with batman when i was a kid. what i find so interesting about him as a character is that, as far a superhero goes, he’s not superhuman, he is a person. and he is a tortured soul who is grappling with his past and trying to find a way to be in a world that has a lot that’s wrong with it and trying to find a way to reconcile all of that.” in justice league, fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by superman’s selfless act, bruce wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, diana prince, to face an even greater enemy. together, batman and wonder woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. but despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—batman, wonder woman, aquaman, cyborg and the flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. justice league is directed by zack snyder, from a screenplay by chris terrio, based on a story by snyder and terrio, and stars ben affleck, henry cavill, gal gadot, jason momoa, ezra miller, ray fisher, amy adams, willem dafoe, jesse eisenberg, jeremy irons, diane lane, connie nielsen, j. k. simmons, and ciarán hinds.",1

480,Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005,"donald trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women during a  conversation caught on a hot microphone, saying that ""when you're a star, they let you do it,"" according to a video obtained by the washington post. the video captures trump talking with billy bush, then of ""access hollywood,"" on a bus with the show's name written across the side. they were arriving on the set of ""days of our lives"" to tape a segment about trump's cameo on the soap opera. late friday night, following sharp criticism by republican leaders, trump issued a short video statement saying, ""i said it, i was wrong, and i apologize."" but he also called the revelation ""a distraction from the issues we are facing today."" he said that his ""foolish"" words are much different than the words and actions of bill clinton, whom he accused of abusing women, and hillary clinton, whom he accused of having ""bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims."" ""i've never said i'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that i'm not. i've said and done things i regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who i am,"" trump said. in an apparent response to republican critics asking him to drop out of the race, he said: ""we will discuss this more in the coming days. see you at the debate on sunday."" the tape includes audio of bush and trump talking inside the bus, as well as audio and video once they emerge from it to begin shooting the segment. in that audio, trump discusses a failed attempt to seduce a woman, whose full name is not given in the video. ""i moved on her, and i failed. i'll admit it,"" trump is heard saying. it was unclear when the events he was describing took place. the tape was recorded several months after he married his third wife, melania. ""i did try and f--- her. she was married,"" trump says. trump continues: ""and i moved on her very heavily. in fact, i took her out furniture shopping. she wanted to get some furniture. i said, 'i'll show you where they have some nice furniture.'"" ""i moved on her like a bitch, but i couldn't get there. and she was married,"" trump says. ""then all of a sudden i see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. she's totally changed her look."" at that point in the audio, trump and bush appear to notice arianne zucker, the actress who is waiting to escort them into the soap-opera set. ""your girl's hot as s---, in the purple,"" says bush, who's now a co-host of nbc's ""today"" show. ""i've got to use some tic tacs, just in case i start kissing her,"" trump says. ""you know i'm automatically attracted to beautiful - i just start kissing them. it's like a magnet. just kiss. i don't even wait."" ""and when you're a star, they let you do it,"" trump says. ""you can do anything."" ""whatever you want,"" says another voice, apparently bush's. ""grab them by the p---y,"" trump says. ""you can do anything.""  a spokeswoman for nbc universal, which produces and distributes ""access hollywood,"" declined to comment. ""this was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. bill clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close,"" trump said in a statement. ""i apologize if anyone was offended."" billy bush, in a statement released by nbc universal, said: ""obviously i'm embarrassed and ashamed. it's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago - i was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. i'm very sorry."" after the video appeared online friday afternoon, democratic nominee hillary clinton wrote on twitter: ""this is horrific. we cannot allow this man to become president."" her running mate, sen. tim kaine (va.), told reporters, ""it makes me sick to my stomach,"" while campaigning in las vegas. planned parenthood action fund, which has endorsed clinton, issued a statement from executive vice president dawn laguens saying: ""what trump described in these tapes amounts to sexual assault."" trump was also criticized by members of his own party. house speaker paul d. ryan, who said he is ""sickened"" by trump's comments, said the republican presidential candidate will no longer appear with him at a campaign event in wisconsin on saturday. ""women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. i hope mr. trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,"" ryan said in a statement. in a short statement issued moments after ryan's, trump said his running mate, indiana gov. mike pence, ""will be representing me"" at the wisconsin event. sen. kelly ayotte (n.h.), who is running for reelection and has said she will vote for trump, called his comments ""totally inappropriate and offensive."" republican national committee chairman reince priebus, who has stood by trump uncritically through numerous controversies, said in a statement: ""no woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. ever."" former presidential candidate mitt romney, a trump critic, said in a statement: ""hitting on married women? condoning assault? such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt america's face to the world."" senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said the comments are ""repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance"" and made clear trump's brief statement would not suffice. ""as the father of three daughters, i strongly believe that trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,"" he said late friday. one of trump's most prominent social-conservative supporters, tony perkins of the family research council, told buzzfeed's rosie gray: ""my personal support for donald trump has never been based upon shared values."" trump's running mate, pence, was at a diner in toledo when the news broke - about to view the diner's collection of signed cardboard hot-dog buns, which includes one signed by trump. but the reporters traveling with pence were quickly ushered out of the diner by campaign staff, before they could ask trump's running mate about it, according to politico. politico reported that the journalists, traveling in pence's ""protective pool,"" were not permitted to film pence as he left the diner. the tape appears at a time when trump, the republican presidential nominee, has sought to make a campaign issue out of his opponent's marriage. trump has criticized former president bill clinton for his past infidelity and criticized opponent hillary clinton as her husband's ""enabler."" ""hillary clinton was married to the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics,"" trump told the new york times in a recent interview. ""hillary was an enabler, and she attacked the women who bill clinton mistreated afterward. i think it's a serious problem for them, and it's something that i'm considering talking about more in the near future."" trump carried on a very public affair with marla maples - his eventual second wife - while still married to first wife ivana trump. trump has been criticized in this campaign for derogatory and lewd comments about women, including some made on tv and live radio. in an interview wednesday with ksnv, a las vegas television station, trump said that those comments were made for entertainment. ""a lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment. there's nobody that has more respect for women than i do,"" he told the station. ""are you trying to tone it down now?"" asked the interviewer, jim snyder. ""it's not a question of trying, it's very easy,"" trump said. the tape obtained by the post seems to have captured trump in a private moment, with no audience beyond bush and a few others on the bus. it appears to have been shot around sept. , , which was the day media reports said trump would tape his soap-opera cameo. the video shows the bus carrying trump and bush turning down a street on the studio back lot. the two men cannot be seen. ""oof, get out of the way, honey,"" bush says, apparently referencing somebody else blocking the view of zucker. the two men then exit the bus and greet zucker. ""we're ready, let's go,"" trump says, after the initial greetings. ""make me a soap star."" ""how about a little hug for the donald?"" bush says. ""he just got off the bus."" ""would you like a little hug, darling?"" zucker says. ""absolutely,"" trump says. as they embrace, and air-kiss, trump says, ""melania said this was okay."" the video then follows trump, bush and zucker into the studio. trump did appear on ""days of our lives"" in late october. in a tape of that cameo posted online, zucker's character asks trump - playing himself - for a job at his business, and tells him suggestively, ""i think you'll find i'm a very willing employee. working under you, i think, could be mutually beneficial."" trump's character gives her the brushoff. ""that's an interesting proposition,"" trump says on-screen. ""i'll get back to you."" a publicist for zucker did not immediately respond to questions on friday afternoon. rosalind s. helderman, mike debonis, jenna johnson and sarah parnass contributed to this report. also read: the  electoral map is rapidly slilpping away from donald trump when news of trump taxes broke, he went off onto angry tangents 'donald trump will protect you': some fear he's running to be a dictator",1

""i have had some bad binges while making movies. at the end of the witches of eastwick, michelle pfeiffer, susan sarandon and i really went crazy. we'd go from one of our trailers to the other stuffing ourselves with pepperidge farm cheddar cheese goldfish, m&ms, cokes and hershey's kisses,"" she wrote.

""i think sarah was right: people don't want to believe that we get on. they have too much invested in the idea of two strong, successful women fighting with each other. it makes for juicy gossip and copy. the truth of us being friends and getting along and happily doing our jobs together is where near as newsworthy. i think sarah is fantastic. . . . she and i are sick of this. it's exhausting talking about it, and a real bore."" well, it's been six years since that interview. now we have social media, which allows us to get words and images straight from celebrities' mouths with no publication acting as a middle man to possibly filter or alter their quotes. so behold an image of kim cattrall posted by sarah jessica parker on her birthday. look at the caption in which parker calls cattrall a beauty and wishes her joy and an adventure-filled year. it's just like carrie said: ""friendships never go out of style."" or like samantha said: ""i support you, and these bitches need to be put in their places.""",1

(january isn’t great for gomez, either, who checks into rehab .) the tabloids viciously suggest it’s because of bieber and/or a drug problem, but a frustrated gomez later tells gq that it was to seek help for lupus. but before the rehab and before the dui, the couple is spotted riding segways in calabasas, california . throughout the year, and all the drama, the “maybe dates” continue: a starbucks run in texas and a day at the zoo. then, the instagram—bieber posts (and also deletes) a bunch of pictures of his former beau, including one that calls their love “unconditional.” but concurrently woven in those sightings are other ones . . . with bieber and other women. he’s associated with a slew of models, up-and-coming actresses, and other beauties—including kendall and kylie jenner, who gomez at one point reportedly unfollows on instagram , and she also unfollowed bieber. then there’s the international incident in july , when orlando bloom and justin bieber get into fist fight , allegedly over gomez. in november, gomez releases “the heart wants what it wants,” which she suggests is about bieber. she gives an emotional performance of the song at the american music awards, which some signal to mean the relationship has finally run its course. that same month, bieber unfollows her on instagram . in december, he posts a picture of himself with hailey baldwin, but in the caption says he’s “super single.” —are they or aren’t they?

494,Kim Kardashian explains why she won’t be voting for Trump after all,"for a moment there, it seemed that hillary clinton had lost the kim kardashian vote. the reality tv star backed clinton as early as august  and, in typical kim kardashian fashion, had declared her allegiance via selfie. but last week, reports emerged that kardashian was thinking of voting for donald trump after caitlyn jenner — a republican who spoke during the party’s convention this summer — encouraged her to reconsider her vote. it all stemmed from a kardashian quote attributed to an upcoming wonderland magazine cover story. the quote does not appear in the online version of the magazine, but buzzfeed reports that it did appear in an advance version sent to certain outlets, including to buzzfeed uk. the reported quote read: “at first i thought, ‘oh my god, i’m so hillary ,’ but i had a long political call with caitlyn  last night about why she’s voting trump. i’m on the fence.” headlines declared “kim kardashian is suddenly (and disappointingly) considering voting for donald trump,” “caitlyn jenner convinces kim kardashian to consider trump” and “hillary clinton supporter kim kardashian might vote for donald trump.” and, according to kardashian, her phone blew up with messages from family, friends and both candidates’ camps. so she took to her website saturday night and explained why she was “‘on the fence’ about my vote,” she wrote.  “there was a point when i wasn’t % sure i was even going to vote in this election; i didn’t want to vote blindly,” she wrote. “but i also thought about how not voting would mean that i wasn’t making my voice heard, so i decided to talk to my closest friends and family who i love and trust, to have an open conversation about politics.” she spoke with jenner, who encouraged her “to do my research before making my decision and then vote for the candidate whose policies aligned with the things that matter most to me.” for kardashian, that included “gun control and protecting women’s rights to safe and legal abortion.” kardashian continued: “i found that without a doubt, i stand with hillary. i’m with her. i believe hillary will best represent our country and is the most qualified for the job. this year, i’m not just voting for myself, but also for my children, and i took that into careful consideration when i made my decision.” she also wrote that she believed both clinton and trump “have the intention of making the country a safer and stronger place for every american.” jenner, for her part, has made varying statements about trump and clinton. in a march episode of her show, “i am cait,” she said she was not a trump fan because of “his macho attitude” but would “never ever ever vote for hillary. we’re done, if hillary becomes president. the country is over.” but in august, jenner told hbo’s bill simmons, “i honestly have not outwardly supported anybody.” kim kardashian: ‘i want my children to grow up knowing that their lives matter.’",1

""i think when you're in a relationship, you are constantly scrutinised, your friends are scrutinised, but ..."" he trails off and stares at me, ramping up the intensity of his eyes like he's done in so many roles. but what? gyllenhaal just continues to stare. then he performs an exaggerated shrug. so, er, did he listen to any of the many songs rumored to be about him? more silence. the atmosphere has become uncomfortably tense. would he like to move on? ""i would love to not talk about my personal life."" i don't think this is, massively. ""oh, really? you don't?"" he asks. are you s-h-i-v-e-r-i-n-g yet? put on another layer because later gyllenhaal recounts his time meeting obama and manages to bring it back to the question. "" told me: 'you have a job as an artist to help people through difficult times, to illuminate things through art.' he said: 'that's your job.' and my parents have always said that, too. and i'm sure you know it, because you seem like a very smart person who has done their research, particularly into tabloid research, which is obviously the most important of all research."" and that's not it for the siberian tundra of an actor. still on politics, gyllenhaal says, ""so, it's an irony to me when people say: 'an entertainer or actor should not be political,' because it's very easy to sideline people and, for instance, ask about past relationships or things that i believe are meant to be private."" gyllenhaal is the iceberg, and jonze, the titanic, completely sunk by gyllenhaal's final act: ""muttering"" to a handler, ""it's always the last ."" we've all learned a valuable lesson, too. gyllenhaal's life is fair game, but his life is not. vanity fair has reached out to gyllenhaal for comment.",1
